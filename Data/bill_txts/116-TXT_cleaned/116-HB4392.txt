•HR 4392 IH
(1) Since August 2017, the Burmese military, 
1
the Tatmadaw, has engaged in a brutal crackdown 
2
on the Rohingya population in the northern Rakhine 
3
state of Burma (formerly Myanmar). 
4
(2) Before the 2017 crisis, an estimated 
5
1,000,000 Rohingya people lived in the Rakhine 
6
state. 
7
(3) As a result of the brutal crackdown of 
8
2017, 740,000 Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh 
9
and another 127,000 Rohingya fled to camps for in-
10
ternally displaced persons (IDPs) in the central 
11
Rakhine state. 
12
(4) Bangladesh was already enduring a humani-
13
tarian crisis as a result of approximately 287,000 
14
Rohingya refugees fleeing Burma during earlier 
15
crackdowns by the Burmese military in 2012 and 
16
2016. 
17
(5) In March 2019, the United Nations Office 
18
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs esti-
19
mated there were 909,000 registered Rohingya in 
20
Bangladeshi refugee camps. 
21
(6) On March 5, 2019, the United States Agen-
22
cy for International Development reported that the 
23
United 
States 
has 
contributed 
more 
than 
24
$494,000,000 to Bangladesh since August 2017 in 
25

•HR 4392 IH
order to help Bangladesh cope with the influx of 
1
Rohingya refugees. 
2
(7) The U.S. Secretary of State has called the 
3
Burmese security forces attacks on the Rohingya an 
4
‘‘ethnic cleansing’’ but has yet to recognize them as 
5
a crime against humanity or genocide. 
6
(8) On December 13, 2018, the United States 
7
House of Representatives passed House Resolution 
8
1091, which expressed the sense of the House that 
9
‘‘the atrocities committed against the Rohingya by 
10
the Burmese military and security forces since Au-
11
gust 2017 constitute crimes against humanity and 
12
genocide’’ and called upon the Secretary of State to 
13
review the available evidence and make a similar de-
14
termination. 
15
(9) The United Nations Human Rights Coun-
16
cil’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission 
17
on Myanmar (the Mission) concluded in August 
18
2018 and August 2019 reports that ‘‘there is suffi-
19
cient information to warrant the investigation and 
20
prosecution’’ of Tatmadaw officials to determine 
21
their ‘‘liability for genocide’’ and also found that a 
22
‘‘pervasive culture of impunity at the domestic 
23
level,’’ which led the Mission to conclude that ‘‘the 
24

•HR 4392 IH
impetus for accountability must come from the inter-
1
national community’’. 
2
(10) The ability of Rohingyas to leave Ban-
3
gladesh to return home is impeded by many factors, 
4
not least of which: the lack of Burmese citizenship 
5
for the Rohingya minority, that the homes of the 
6
Rohingya were largely destroyed in the 2017 vio-
7
lence, and that Rohingya still fear the ongoing vio-
8
lence due to the civil war and military officers who 
9
act with impunity against the local civilian popu-
10
lation. 
11
(11) In 2016, after a 27-year suspension pe-
12
riod, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) 
13
program for Burma was re-instated, and Burma was 
14
designated as a least-developed beneficiary devel-
15
oping country under the program. 
16
(12) Just one year after having the GSP pro-
17
gram reinstated, Burma’s GSP-eligible exports to 
18
the United States were valued at $93,900,000, the 
19
second highest value for least-developed beneficiary 
20
developing countries after Cambodia.
