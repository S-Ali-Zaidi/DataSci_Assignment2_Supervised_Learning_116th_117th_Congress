RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the American Peanut Shellers Association for 
their exemplary services and dedicated efforts to support 
our Nation’s peanut industry over the past 100 years. 
Whereas the American Peanut Shellers Association (APSA) 
was established by commercial peanut shellers and 
crushers from Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, who began 
operations in early 1918 as the Southeastern Peanut As-
sociation (SPA); 
Whereas approximately one year later, on April 5, 1919, a 
group of commercial peanut farmers representing their 
home States convened in Atlanta to officially charter the 
Southeastern Peanut Association;

Whereas, in 1965, the APSA cosponsored first USA Peanut 
Congress—the largest meeting of all segments of the pea-
nut industry; 
Whereas on November 30, 1993, the Southeastern Peanut 
Association officially changed its name to the American 
Peanut Shellers Association to incorporate other shelling 
companies from other States; 
Whereas the current APSA headquarters in Albany, Georgia, 
was completed in 1986 and has been the official hub of 
this renowned association since its relocation from Amer-
icus, Georgia, in the early in 1960s; 
Whereas, for the past 100 years, Georgia peanut farmers 
through the APSA have been successful in improving the 
quality and safety and increasing the profitability of pea-
nuts and peanut products by working to promote and in-
crease consumption; 
Whereas, today, the APSA is the oldest organized group in 
the peanut industry boasting 10 active member shelling 
companies and 145 associate members who handle 90 
percent of the peanuts grown in the United States; 
Whereas Georgia leads the Nation in production of peanuts 
with nearly 50 percent of the annual peanut crop; 
Whereas Georgia has 14,000 farms with peanuts and about 
4,500 active farmers; 
Whereas approximately 200 businesses in Georgia are peanut 
related; 
Whereas two million bags of peanuts are distributed annually 
and the industry contributes more than 50,000 jobs and 
an estimated $2 billion to the economy of the State of 
Georgia;

Whereas, since George Washington Carver discovered the 
many uses for the peanut in the early twentieth century, 
peanuts have become a household food staple and a 
source of dietary fiber, protein, and other healthy nutri-
ents; 
Whereas although peanuts are produced in other parts of the 
country, no peanuts are of higher quality or more deli-
cious than Georgia peanuts; and 
Whereas the hard work of John Powell, Executive Director 
of the American Peanut Shellers Association, and the 
rest of the wonderful staff as well as Chairman Ralph 
Johnson and all those who serve on the Associate Board 
of Directors has contributed to the success of the APSA 
in many ways: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes the American Peanut Shellers Association for their

exemplary services and dedicated efforts to support our

Nation’s peanut industry over the past 100 years.
