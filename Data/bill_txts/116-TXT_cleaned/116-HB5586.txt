•HR 5586 IH
(1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earth-
1
quake struck near the Haitian capital city of Port- 
2
au-Prince, leaving an estimated 220,000 people 
3
dead, including 103 United States citizens, 101 
4
United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent of 
5
the nation’s civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, 
6
115,000 homes destroyed, and 1,500,000 people dis-
7
placed. 
8
(2) The Post Disaster Needs Assessment con-
9
ducted by the Government of Haiti, the United Na-
10
tions, the World Bank, the Inter-American Develop-
11
ment Bank, and others estimated that damage and 
12
economic losses from the January 12, 2010, earth-
13
quake totaled $7,804,000,000. 
14
(3) The international community, led by the 
15
United States and the United Nations, mounted an 
16
unprecedented humanitarian response to the earth-
17
quake in Haiti. Through 2018, more than $8 billion 
18
has been disbursed by donors. Since the 2010 earth-
19
quake, the United States Government has disbursed 
20
more than $4,000,000,000 in recovery and develop-
21
ment funding. 
22
(4) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew 
23
struck southwestern Haiti on the Tiburon Peninsula, 
24
causing widespread damage and flooding and leaving

1.4 million people in need of immediate assistance. 
1
The strongest storm to hit Haiti since Hurricane 
2
Cleo in 1964, 2.1 million people were directly af-
3
fected by the hurricane. 
4
(5) Recovery efforts continue almost 3 years 
5
after Hurricane Matthew made landfall in 2016. 
6
The World Bank estimates storm-caused losses and 
7
damages valued at 32 percent of 2015 Gross Domes-
8
tic Product. 
9
(6) Prior to both the earthquake and hurricane, 
10
Haiti registered among the lowest socioeconomic in-
11
dicators and the second highest rate of income dis-
12
parity in the world, conditions that have further 
13
complicated disaster recovery and resilience efforts. 
14
(7) In June 2019, World Food Program re-
15
ported that Haiti has one of the highest levels of 
16
chronic food insecurity in the world with more than 
17
half of its total population chronically food insecure 
18
and 22 percent of children chronically malnourished. 
19
(8) In October 2010, an unprecedented out-
20
break of cholera in Haiti resulted in over 800,000 
21
reported cases and over 9,000 deaths to date. The 
22
Pan American Health Organization reported in 2018 
23
that the cholera incidence rate in Haiti is 25.5 cases 
24
per 100,000.

(9) With United States assistance, almost 
1
14,000 jobs have been created, largely in the apparel 
2
industry at the Caracol Industrial Park (in partner-
3
ship with the Inter-American Development Bank, 
4
the Haitian government, and the private sector) in 
5
northern Haiti. 
6
(10) Evidence suggests that people displaced by 
7
the 2010 earthquake and hurricanes in following 
8
years, especially Hurricane Matthew in 2016, still 
9
face displacement-related vulnerabilities today. 
10
(11) On November 13, 2018, at least 59 people 
11
were shot and killed in the Port-au-Prince neighbor-
12
hood of La Saline. After months of investigations, 
13
no one has been held responsible for the La Saline 
14
massacre. 
15
(12) Since 2018, tens of thousands of Haitians 
16
have participated in a series of demonstrations de-
17
manding accountability over government spending of 
18
Petrocaribe resources. In early 2019, the Haitian su-
19
perior court of auditors released an investigation im-
20
plicating high-level government officials in the mis-
21
appropriation of funds. 
22
(13) From August 2018 through February 
23
2019, local human rights organizations reported that 
24
64 Haitian citizens were killed in protests.

(14) In 2019, according to the Committee to 
1
Protect Journalists, five Haitian journalists have 
2
been shot while covering protests, including one who 
3
was killed. On September 23, 2019, Haitian Senator 
4
Jean Marie Ralph Fe´thie`re shot Associated Press 
5
photojournalist Chery Dieu-Nalio in the face after he 
6
exited his car and fired multiple shots near a crowd 
7
of people surrounding him. 
8
(15) Economic growth in Haiti is projected to 
9
drop below 1.5 percent this year. Inflation is esti-
10
mated to be 15 percent and the local currency has 
11
depreciated by 30 percent in the past year. The gov-
12
ernment and parliament have failed to pass a budget 
13
for two years, preventing the International Monetary 
14
Fund and other multilaterals from disbursing mil-
15
lions in international assistance. 
16
(16) Midterm elections set for October 2019 did 
17
not take place and will leave President Moise ruling 
18
by decree after two-thirds of the Haitian Senate ex-
19
pires in January 2020.
