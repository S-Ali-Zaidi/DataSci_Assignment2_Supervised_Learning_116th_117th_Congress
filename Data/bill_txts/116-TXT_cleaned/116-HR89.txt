drinking from a water source reserved solely for Muslim 
use; 
Whereas, in November 2010, Asia Bibi, was sentenced to 
death by hanging after being convicted of blasphemy by 
a Pakistani District Court under Article 295–C of Paki-
stan’s penal code; 
Whereas Asia Bibi appealed her sentence, but it was upheld 
in October 2014 by the Lahore High Court of Appeals; 
Whereas, in October 2018, the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
rightfully acquitted Asia Bibi due to insufficient evidence; 
Whereas Asia Bibi and her family have been forced into hid-
ing for fear of extrajudicial murder; 
Whereas in Pakistan, being accused of blasphemy by either 
the government or a private individual, can lead to vio-
lence against the accused; 
Whereas human rights violations in Pakistan include incon-
sistent due process, poor prison conditions, lengthy and 
arbitrary sentences, and lack of judicial independence; 
and 
Whereas the United States may grant asylum to people who 
have been persecuted by their government on account of 
race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, 
or political belief: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

lum to those with legitimate claims of persecution

for their religion, race, nationality, membership in a
