Whereas the Senate has the sole power to conduct a trial to 
remove the President from office; 
Whereas, during an impeachment trial, the Vice President of 
the United States does not preside over the Senate in his 
or her role as President of the Senate due to a clear con-
flict of interest, but rather the Chief Justice of the 
United States Supreme Court presides; 
Whereas a sitting United States Senator actively seeking the 
Presidency of the United States has a vested interest in 
the reputation and political future of an incumbent Presi-
dent of the United States who is currently serving his or 
her first term in office; 
Whereas Senate rules governing impeachment proceedings re-
quires United States Senators to make the following oath 
prior to an impeachment trial: 
‘‘I solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) 
that in all things appertaining to the trial of the im-
peachment of ——— ———, now pending, I will do im-
partial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So 
help me God.’’; 
Whereas a sitting United States Senator actively seeking to 
unseat the incumbent President of the United States can-
not claim impartiality in his or her political opponent’s 
impeachment trial; and 
Whereas the Constitution grants both chambers of Congress 
the authority to ‘‘determine the Rules of its Pro-
ceedings’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
