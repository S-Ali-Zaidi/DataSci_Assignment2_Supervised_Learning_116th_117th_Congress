•HR 5917 IH
(1) The Tiahrt Amendments severely limit the 
1
authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
2
arms and Explosives (ATF) to disclose crime gun 
3
trace data to the public. 
4
(2) The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collec-
5
tion of valuable information, and the establishment 
6
of effective policies to prevent illegal guns from 
7
being used in crimes. 
8
(3) The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforce-
9
ment of the gun laws by requiring most background 
10
check records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and 
11
by barring the Government from requiring annual 
12
inventory audits by owners of gun shops. 
13
(4) A 2012 study by researchers at Johns Hop-
14
kins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that 
15
the Tiahrt Amendments dramatically increased gun 
16
sales to criminals. 
17
(5) A 2016 study from the University of Pitts-
18
burgh Graduate School of Public Health found that 
19
in 2008, 79 percent of all guns recovered by police 
20
from crime scenes belonged to someone other than 
21
the perpetrator—30 percent had been stolen. 
22
(6) A gun is stolen in the United States every 
23
2 minutes.

•HR 5917 IH
(7) Every year, nearly 115,000 Americans are 
1
shot. 
2
(8) In 2016, 38,658 Americans were killed with 
3
a gun. 
4
(9) In 2016, 289,223 firearms were recovered 
5
and traced in the United States, of which 211,384 
6
were traced to a final retail purchaser. 
7
(10) Having effective policies to prevent illegal 
8
gun trafficking makes our families and communities 
9
safer. 
10
(11) Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would 
11
support law enforcement efforts and give the public 
12
vital information needed to craft the most effective 
13
policies against illegal guns.
