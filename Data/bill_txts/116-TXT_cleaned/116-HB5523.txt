A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide 
investment and production tax credits for emerging en-
ergy technologies, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Energy Sector Innova-
4

SEC. 2. PURPOSES. 
6
The energy sector innovation credit is a technology- 
7
neutral approach that would leverage new private invest-
8
ment in nascent clean technologies, help cutting-edge tech-

nologies break into the market, and then naturally 
1
phasedown as each technology proves commercial viability. 
2
It could bring about the new technologies needed to quick-
3
ly and cheaply reduce global emissions. The innovation 
4
ESIC incentivizes is key to a strong energy supply plus 
5
will help address the climate and environmental challenge 
6
of this generation. The United States must lead on clean 
7
energy technology development.
