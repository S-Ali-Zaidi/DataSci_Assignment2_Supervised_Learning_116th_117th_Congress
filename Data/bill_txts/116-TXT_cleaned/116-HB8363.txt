The Congress finds as follows:

24

•HR 8363 IH
Trump v. Mazars, Congress’ ‘‘power of inquiry— 
1
with process to enforce it—is an essential and ap-
2
propriate auxiliary to the legislative function’’. Con-
3
gress’ power to obtain information, including 
4
through the issuance of subpoenas and the enforce-
5
ment of such subpoenas, is ‘‘broad and indispen-
6
sable’’. 
7
(2) Congress ‘‘suffers a concrete and particular-
8
ized injury when denied the opportunity to obtain in-
9
formation necessary’’ to the exercise of its constitu-
10
tional functions, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
11
the District of Columbia Circuit correctly recognized 
12
in its August 7, 2020, en banc decision in Com-
13
mittee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Rep-
14
resentatives v. McGahn. 
15
(3) Accordingly, the Constitution secures to 
16
each House of Congress an inherent right to enforce 
17
its subpoenas in court. Explicit statutory authoriza-
18
tion is not required to secure such a right of action, 
19
and the contrary holding by a divided panel of the 
20
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
21
Circuit in McGahn, entered on August 31, 2020, 
22
was in error.
