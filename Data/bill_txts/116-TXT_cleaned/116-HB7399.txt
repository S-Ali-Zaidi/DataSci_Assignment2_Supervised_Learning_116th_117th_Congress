15
section (a) shall include the following: 
16
(1) An assessment of— 
17
(A) the use of the shadow price of carbon 
18

(3) An assessment of whether the shadow price 
1
of carbon should be— 
2

3
Federal agencies use to conduct regulatory 
4
analyses of economically significant regulatory 
5
actions; 
6
(B) tied to a path that minimizes the cost 
7
of achieving a long-term cumulative emissions 
8
goal; or 
9
(C) based on some other rationale. 
10
(4) An identification and evaluation of any stat-
11
utory, regulatory, or other obstacle to the use of the

14
date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the
