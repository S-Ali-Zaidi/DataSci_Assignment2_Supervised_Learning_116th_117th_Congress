Nancy Pelosi should be removed from her position as 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
Whereas Representative Nancy Pelosi assumed the office of 
Speaker of the House of Representatives on January 3, 
2019; 
Whereas since January 3, 2019, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has 
spent the majority of the House of Representative’s time 
pursuing baseless and fruitless investigations against the 
administration of President Donald J. Trump and those 
close to him; 
Whereas under the reign of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the House 
of Representatives has passed hundreds fewer bills than

•HRES 1194 IH 
it passed in the 115th Congress, with the majority of its 
attention being turned to committee hearings inves-
tigating the President and his aides; 
Whereas, on September 24, 2019, Speaker Nancy Pelosi uni-
laterally and unconstitutionally announced that the 
House of Representatives would begin an impeachment 
inquiry into President Donald J. Trump; 
Whereas, on October 15, 2019, Speaker Nancy Pelosi incor-
rectly stated that there is ‘‘no requirement’’ to vote to 
begin impeachment proceedings against the President of 
the United States; 
Whereas, on October 31, 2019, Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
oversaw the first party-line vote to begin an impeachment 
inquiry into a President in the history of our country, 
permitting a resolution that denied the President due 
process; 
Whereas Speaker Nancy Pelosi permitted several House com-
mittees to embark on a fishing expedition in hopes she 
could justify her efforts to impeach President Trump, 
only to push through baseless articles of impeachment, 
impeaching President Trump on December 18, 2019; 
Whereas, on February 5, 2020, Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped 
up the State of the Union speech delivered by President 
Trump before the American people; 
Whereas, on August 31, 2020, Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited 
a shuttered hair salon in San Francisco where she re-
ceived a blowout without wearing a mask in violation of 
San Francisco’s laws concerning the coronavirus, forcing 
the salon owner to do her hair, an action in stark con-
tradiction to her hypocritical admonitions of the Presi-
dent’s actions during the coronavirus;

•HRES 1194 IH 
Whereas in the days following her unlawful hair salon ap-
pointment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi cast blame on the sa-
lon’s owner for ‘‘setting her up’’; 
Whereas, on September 21, 2020, Speaker Pelosi, while dis-
cussing the possibility of a second attempt by her to im-
peach President Trump, appeared confused and exhibited 
bizarre behavior during an ABC interview, blurting out 
randomly ‘‘Good Morning, Sunday Morning’’; 
Whereas during the tenure of her speakership, Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi has started to demonstrate a decline in 
mental fitness, calling into question her ability to ade-
quately serve the House of Representatives and the 
American people; 
Whereas Speaker Nancy Pelosi, having failed in all previous 
endeavors to remove President Trump, is now calling for 
an invocation of the 25th Amendment, claiming President 
Trump is unfit to continue serving as President; 
Whereas the 25th Amendment provides that the Vice Presi-
dent shall become President ‘‘in case of the removal of 
the President from office or of his death or resignation’’; 
Whereas the Constitution provides two processes for remov-
ing the President from office, the first of which is im-
peachment, which Speaker Nancy Pelosi unsuccessfully 
attempted, and the second of which requires the Vice 
President and a majority of ‘‘either the principal officers 
of the executive departments or of such other body as 
Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President 
pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker’’ a written 
declaration that the President is unable to discharge the 
power and duties of his office;

•HRES 1194 IH 
Whereas any efforts outside of impeachment to remove Presi-
dent Trump must have the consent of Vice President 
Mike Pence; 
Whereas Speaker Pelosi has historically ignored the Constitu-
tion’s obligations and requirements and has recently sig-
naled she will do so again in her continuing efforts to re-
move President Trump; 
Whereas, as Speaker of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is 
third in the line of succession; and 
Whereas Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s unwillingness to abide by 
the Constitution and her recent actions that call into 
question her own mental fitness to continue serving as 
Speaker of the House demand her removal from the line 
of succession: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) Representative Nancy Pelosi is mentally 
3
unfit to continue serving as Speaker of the House of 
4
Representatives; and 
5
(2) Representative Nancy Pelosi should be re-

moved from her position as Speaker.
