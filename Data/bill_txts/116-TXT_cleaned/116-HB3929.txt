Compliance Board to develop a minimum nonvisual ac-
cess standard for home use medical devices, exercise 
equipment, and home appliances, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

•HR 3929 IH
(1) Rapid advances in digital technology have 
1
led to increasingly complex user interfaces for every-
2
day products such as home use medical devices, 
3
home appliances, and exercise equipment. Many new 
4
devices in these categories utilize displays that can 
5
only be operated visually and require user inter-
6
action with on-screen menus and other interfaces 
7
that are inaccessible to consumers who are blind. 
8
(2) The use of interfaces which must be oper-
9
ated visually on exercise equipment such as tread-
10
mills and elliptical machines make these devices un-
11
usable by people who are blind. This lack of access 
12
is a potential threat to a blind person improving 
13
their health and a barrier to maintaining their phys-
14
ical well-being. 
15
(3) The use of interfaces which must be oper-
16
ated visually on home appliances such as laundry 
17
machines, dishwashers, and stoves make these de-
18
vices difficult, if not impossible, to use by people 
19
who are blind. This lack of access is a potential bar-
20
rier to independent living and overall quality of life. 
21
(4) Increasingly, home use medical devices are 
22
being utilized to lessen the cost of medical care for 
23
consumers. Devices such as blood pressure monitors, 
24
sleep apnea machines, and in-home chemotherapy

•HR 3929 IH
treatment devices generally lack nonvisual accessi-
1
bility. If a home use medical device is not accessible 
2
in a nonvisual manner, a blind person cannot use it 
3
efficiently and independently. The lack of nonvisual 
4
accessibility in these devices poses major health risks 
5
for blind consumers, including potentially life-threat-
6
ening consequences. 
7
(5) Screen access technology has become inex-
8
pensive and is in wider use than ever before. Many 
9
technology companies have incorporated screen ac-
10
cess technology functionalities into their products. 
11
Screen access technology is not the only mechanism 
12
by which home use medical devices, exercise equip-
13
ment, and home appliances can be made accessible 
14
to blind consumers. In some cases, tactile markings, 
15
audible tones, or cost-effective and widely available 
16
text-to-speech technology may be sufficient to make 
17
such devices fully accessible. Devices can be designed 
18
to work with nonvisual access technology used by the 
19
blind at little or no extra cost as long as such com-
20
patibility is taken into consideration at the begin-
21
ning of the design process. 
22
(6) Consumers who are blind must be able to 
23
operate home use medical devices, exercise equip-
24
ment, and home appliances in an equally effective
