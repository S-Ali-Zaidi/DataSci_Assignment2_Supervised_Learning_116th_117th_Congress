RESOLUTION 
Expressing concern for the United States-Turkey alliance. 
Whereas the United States and Turkey have been treaty al-
lies since 1952, when Turkey became a member of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); 
Whereas the United States and Turkey are treaty bound to 
safeguard the principles of democracy, individual liberty, 
and the rule of law, as well as to unite their efforts for 
collective defense and the preservation of peace and secu-
rity;

Whereas Turkey is in a unique geostrategic position on 
NATO’s southeastern flank, at the confluence of Europe, 
Russia, the Middle East, and the Caucasus; 
Whereas Turkey is a critical NATO ally and important mili-
tary partner for the United States, contributing to key 
NATO and United States missions and providing support 
for United States military operations and logistics needs; 
Whereas Turkey permits United States military access to 
Turkish territorial waters, airspace, and base and port 
facilities, and hosts over 2,000 members of the United 
States Armed Forces, air defense equipment, and other 
equipment necessary to conduct global operations and 
power projection; 
Whereas Turkey is a key player in the long-term strategic 
competition Western allies face with revisionist powers 
such as Russia and China; 
Whereas despite the fact that Turkey shares key regional in-
terests with the United States, its cooperation with Rus-
sia and Iran, its military occupation of northern Cyprus, 
its rollback of democratic norms and institutions, includ-
ing attacks on the free press, and its continued unjust 
detention of United States citizens and locally employed 
United States Embassy staff is deeply problematic for 
the United States-Turkey relationship; 
Whereas the United States recognizes that Turkey perceives 
growing regional security threats from aircraft and bal-
listic missiles and sees an urgent need for a new air and 
missile defense system; 
Whereas Turkey announced an agreement to acquire the S– 
400 air and missile defense system from Russia in July

2017 and has publicly stated it could take delivery as 
early as July 2019; 
Whereas section 231 of the Countering America’s Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act of 2017 (CAATSA) requires the 
President to impose sanctions on any individual or entity 
that engages in a significant transaction with the Rus-
sian defense or intelligence sector; 
Whereas the United States Government has developed an at-
tractive alternative offer to provide Turkey with a strong, 
capable, NATO-interoperable air and missile defense sys-
tem that meets Turkey’s defense requirements; 
Whereas Turkey’s planned acquisition of the Russian-made 
S–400 undermines the security of the United States and 
NATO allies, weakens the United States-Turkey relation-
ship, and is incompatible with Turkey’s plan to operate 
the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter and participate in F–35 
production; 
Whereas the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter program is the 
world’s leading 5th generation fighter aircraft program 
with more than a trillion dollars in investment among 
United States and international partners; 
Whereas Turkey has been a critical partner in the F–35 
Joint Strike Fighter program since 2002, with significant 
industrial participation, including manufacturing of cer-
tain F–35 components, plans to host a maintenance facil-
ity for regional F–35 operators, investments of more than 
$1.25 billion in the program, and plans to procure 100 
F–35As; and 
Whereas in addition to the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter, Turk-
ish defense acquisition programs that could be affected 
by sanctions include the Patriot air and missile defense

7
ed decision to acquire the Russian S–400 air and

in the F–35 industrial program and delivery of F–
