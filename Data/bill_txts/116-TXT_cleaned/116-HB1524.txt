Congress finds the following:

•HR 1524 IH
(1) Kleptocracy is a tool used by autocratic 
1
leaders, including Vladimir Putin, to exploit state re-
2
sources; it involves the operation of sophisticated 
3
networks for the purpose of self-enrichment. 
4
(2) Unlike prior presidents, President Trump 
5
has refused to sell his business interests or divest 
6
himself of assets that present potential conflicts of 
7
interest. 
8
(3) Article I of the Constitution states that ‘‘no 
9
Person holding any office of profit or trust under 
10
them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, ac-
11
cept any present, emolument, office, or title, of any 
12
kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign 
13
State’’. 
14
(4) Foreign governments and foreign-held com-
15
panies have already shifted business to the Presi-
16
dent’s companies in order to curry favor with the 
17
Administration. 
18
(5) According to reports, the Trump Inter-
19
national Hotel has generated at least $19,700,000 in 
20
income for the President between September 2016 
21
and April 2017. 
22
(6) The National Security Council and State 
23
Department have allegedly used taxpayers’ money to

pay for staff to stay at Trump hotels and resorts, 
1
thereby benefitting the President.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of Congress that— 
4
(1) kleptocrats such as Vladimir Putin pose a 
5
threat to United States national security by under-
6
mining financial and Government institutions; 
7
(2) the United States must take all steps nec-
8
essary to defend itself against kleptocratic practices; 
9
and 
10
(3) Federal funds should not be expended in a 
11
manner that enriches the President or any of his 
12
close relatives or associates.
