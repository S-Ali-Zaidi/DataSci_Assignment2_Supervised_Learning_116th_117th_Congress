RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the contributions of distribution and 
warehousing workers during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. 
Whereas the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID–19) 
has led to a state of unprecedented economic disruption 
in the United States; 
Whereas the widespread implementation of stay-at-home 
measures and restrictions on many categories of busi-
nesses produced a surge in demand for delivery services, 
with its effects felt at every link in the supply chain; 
Whereas employees in warehouses, shipping, and distribution 
centers have been called upon to fulfill this increased de-
mand as essential workers during the pandemic;

Whereas these employees work for long hours in physically 
demanding roles doing tasks essential for the economy; 
Whereas these employees have frequently lacked the personal 
protective equipment needed to fully guard against 
COVID–19; 
Whereas some employees are reported to have contracted the 
virus, and many workers fear that they may contract the 
virus because their essential work means they cannot re-
main at home; and 
Whereas workers in many facilities have requested their com-
panies support them by providing information, safety 
equipment, adequate compensation, and other conditions 
necessary for them to do their jobs with confidence: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) declares that workers involved in the

play a vital role in sustaining the Nation during this
