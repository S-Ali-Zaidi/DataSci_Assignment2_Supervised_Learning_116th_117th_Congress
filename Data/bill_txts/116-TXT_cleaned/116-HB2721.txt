•HR 2721 IH
(1) According to Georgetown University’s Cen-
1
ter on Education and the Workforce, by 2020, the 
2
United States is projected to experience a shortage 
3
of 5,000,000 workers with postsecondary education 
4
or training, including vocational certificates and ap-
5
prenticeship training. 
6
(2) Registered apprenticeships strengthen the 
7
Nation’s economy, create pathways to good-paying 
8
careers, and help meet the Nation’s current work-
9
force demands. 
10
(3) Apprenticeships can help fill the Nation’s 
11
workforce needs, including in fields not traditionally 
12
linked to apprenticeships, such as cybersecurity. 
13
(4) The cybersecurity field has a severe short-
14
age in talent, with over 300,000 job openings today, 
15
according to CyberSeek, an interactive cybersecurity 
16
jobs heat map funded by the Department of Com-
17
merce’s National Institute of Standards and Tech-
18
nology (NIST). 
19
(5) Employers, especially in cybersecurity and 
20
information technology fields, may be unfamiliar 
21
with the apprenticeship model or do not have the ca-
22
pacity or resources to develop and implement their 
23
own training.
