A BILL 
To improve the coordination of programs to provide trade 
capacity building assistance, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Aid for Trade Act of 
4
2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Productive international trading relation-
8
ships are vital to the economic growth and national 
9
security of the United States.

(2) According to the United States Agency for 
1
International Development, 11 of America’s top 15 
2
trading partners were once recipients of United 
3
States foreign assistance, and some of the fastest 
4
growing markets are former recipients of United 
5
States foreign assistance. 
6
(3) Stable trading relationships promote secu-
7
rity and prosperity, and leadership by the United 
8
States in international trade fosters the expansion of 
9
open markets and can help level the playing field for 
10
United States businesses, workers, and consumers in 
11
the global marketplace. 
12
(4) Programs to provide trade capacity building 
13
assistance strengthen good governance, advance rule 
14
of law, combat corruption, promote human rights, 
15
reduce poverty, and spur economic opportunity. 
16
(5) Private-sector-led trade and investment are 
17
fundamental components of inclusive growth and de-
18
velopment. Programs to provide trade capacity build-
19
ing assistance help developing countries to reduce 
20
and eliminate nontariff trade barriers that inhibit 
21
the ability of such countries to implement trade 
22
agreements, participate in the global economy, cre-
23
ate jobs and economic opportunity, and reduce pov-
24
erty.

(6) Reducing trade transaction costs through 
1
trade capacity improvements and trade facilitation 
2
reforms will assist United States exporters and small 
3
and medium-size enterprises reach new customers in 
4
developing countries. Reducing these costs through 
5
trade facilitation reforms will assist developing coun-
6
try businesses to trade and invest with each other 
7
and take advantage of global supply and value 
8
chains. 
9
(7) According to the United States Trade Rep-
10
resentative, ‘‘the United States is one of the largest 
11
single-country providers of trade-related assistance’’ 
12
(also called trade capacity building assistance or 
13
‘‘Aid for Trade’’). 
14
(8) At the 9th Ministerial of the World Trade 
15
Organization in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2013, 
16
the 159 members of the World Trade Organization 
17
(WTO) concluded the Trade Facilitation Agreement 
18
(TFA), the first global WTO trade agreement in 20 
19
years. WTO members amended the WTO agree-
20
ments to include the TFA on November 27, 2014, 
21
and opened it for acceptance by WTO members. The 
22
TFA entered into force on February 22, 2017, after 
23
ratification by two-thirds of the WTO membership. 
24

•HR 2067 IH
(9) The TFA includes measures and obligations 
1
designed to streamline customs procedures, increase 
2
customs transparency, and speed the flow of goods 
3
across borders. 
4
(10) According to the Organization for Eco-
5
nomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), full 
6
implementation of the TFA could reduce trade costs 
7
by as much as an estimated 16.5 percent of low in-
8
come countries, 17 percent for lower-middle income 
9
countries, 14.6 percent for upper-middle income 
10
countries, and 11.8 percent for OECD countries. 
11
(11) The OECD has noted that trade barriers 
12
created by ineffective policies and burdensome rules 
13
and procedures can incentivize corrupt business 
14
practices, and therefore all relevant stakeholders 
15
have an interest in supporting efforts to streamline 
16
trade regulation and reduce non-tariff barriers. 
17
(12) The TFA requires developing countries to 
18
identify impediments to trade facilitation and com-
19
mits developed countries to assist developing coun-
20
tries’ efforts to come into compliance with the obli-
21
gations of the TFA. 
22
(13) The United States is the largest provider 
23
of trade capacity building assistance in the world, 
24
according to the United States Agency for Inter-
25

national Development. In 2017, the United States 
1
Government obligated nearly $1,100,000,000 in 
2
trade capacity building efforts in over 130 countries, 
3
which were implemented by more than a dozen 
4
United States Government departments and agen-
5
cies. 
6
(14) There is no single coordinating agency for 
7
trade capacity building activities in the United 
8
States Government. Each agency has its own proc-
9
esses for ensuring proper and effective programming 
10
of its appropriated funds. 
11
(15) A clear, whole-of-government strategy is 
12
needed to leverage and coordinate limited trade ca-
13
pacity funds to implement the TFA, advance pro-
14
ductive international trading relationships for United 
15
States businesses, workers, consumers, foreign trad-
16
ing partners, and promote inclusive economic growth 
17
and opportunity in developing countries.
