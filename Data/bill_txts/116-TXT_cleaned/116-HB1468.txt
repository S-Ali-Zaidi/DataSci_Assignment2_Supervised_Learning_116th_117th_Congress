SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Over 1 in 3 women experience sexual vio-
3
lence, and 1 in 5 women have survived completed or 
4
attempted rape. Such violence has a devastating im-
5
pact on women’s physical and emotional health, fi-
6
nancial security, and ability to maintain their jobs, 
7
and thus impacts interstate commerce and economic 
8
security. 
9
(2) The Office on Violence Against Women of 
10
the Department of Justice defines domestic violence 
11
as a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship 
12
that is used by one intimate partner to gain or 
13
maintain power and control over another intimate 
14
partner. Domestic violence can include physical, sex-
15
00:57 Mar 16, 2019
H1468
4 
•HR 1468 IH
ual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or 
1
threats of actions that influence another person. Do-
2
mestic violence includes any behaviors that intimi-
3
date, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, frighten, ter-
4
rorize, coerce, threaten, blame, hurt, injure, or 
5
wound an individual. 
6
(3) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
7
vention report that domestic violence or intimate 
8
partner violence is a serious public health issue for 
9
millions of individuals in the United States. Nearly 
10
1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men in the United States 
11
have suffered sexual violence, physical violence, or 
12
stalking by an intimate partner. 
13
(4) Homicide is one of the leading causes of 
14
death for women on the job. Domestic partners or 
15
relatives commit 43 percent of workplace homicides 
16
against women. One study found that intimate part-
17
ner violence resulted in 142 homicides among women 
18
at work in the United States from 2003 to 2008, a 
19
figure which represents 22 percent of the 648 work-
20
place homicides among women during the period. In 
21
fact, in 2010, homicides against women at work in-
22
creased by 13 percent despite continuous declines in 
23
overall workplace homicides in recent years. 
24

•HR 1468 IH
(5) Women in the United States are 11 times 
1
more likely to be murdered with guns than women 
2
in other high-income countries. Female intimate 
3
partners are more likely to be murdered with a fire-
4
arm than all other means combined. The presence of 
5
a gun in domestic violence situations increases the 
6
risk of homicide for women by 500 percent. 
7
(6) Violence can have a dramatic impact on the 
8
survivor of such violence. Studies indicate that 44 
9
percent of surveyed employed adults experienced the 
10
effect of domestic violence in the workplace, and 64 
11
percent indicated their workplace performance was 
12
affected. Another recent survey found that 78 per-
13
cent of offenders used workplace resources to ex-
14
press anger, check up on, pressure, or threaten a 
15
survivor of sexual assault, whether occurring in or 
16
out of the workplace, can impair an employee’s work 
17
performance, require time away from work, and un-
18
dermine the employee’s ability to maintain a job. 
19
Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault survivors lose 
20
their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of 
21
the assaults. 
22
(7) In a study commission by the Office on Vio-
23
lence Against Women of the Department of Justice, 
24
66 percent of respondents said an abusive partner 
25
00:57 Mar 16, 2019
H1468
6 
•HR 1468 IH
had disrupted their ability to complete education or 
1
training through tactics such as not allowing them 
2
access to money to pay for school, socially isolating 
3
the survivor, controlling or monitoring their mobility, 
4
using physical or sexual violence, and damaging or 
5
destroying personal property. 
6
(8) Studies find that 60 percent of single 
7
women lack economic security and 81 percent of 
8
households with single mothers live in economic inse-
9
curity. Significant barriers survivors confront in-
10
clude housing, transportation, and child care. Nine-
11
ty-two percent of homeless women have experienced 
12
domestic violence, and more than 50 percent cite do-
13
mestic violence as the direct cause for homelessness. 
14
Survivors are deprived of their autonomy, liberty, 
15
and security, and face tremendous threats to their 
16
health and safety. 
17
(9) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
18
vention report that survivors of severe intimate part-
19
ner violence lose nearly 8,000,000 days of paid work, 
20
which is the equivalent of more than 32,000 full- 
21
time jobs and almost 5,600,000 days of household 
22
productivity each year. Therefore, women dispropor-
23
tionately need time off to care for their health or to 
24
find safety solutions, such as obtaining a restraining 
25

order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent further 
1
violence. 
2
(10) Annual costs of intimate partner violence 
3
are estimated over $8,300,000,000. According to the 
4
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 
5
costs of intimate partner violence against women in 
6
1995 exceeded an estimated $5,800,000,000. These 
7
costs included nearly $4,100,000,000 in the direct 
8
costs of medical and mental health care and nearly 
9
$1,800,000,000 in the indirect costs of lost produc-
10
tivity. These statistics are generally considered to be 
11
underestimated because the costs associated with the 
12
criminal justice system are not included. 
13
(11) Fifty-five percent of senior executives re-
14
cently surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful 
15
effect on their company’s productivity, and more 
16
than 70 percent said domestic violence negatively af-
17
fects attendance. Seventy-eight percent of human re-
18
sources professionals consider partner violence a 
19
workplace issue. However, more than 70 percent of 
20
United States workplaces have no formal program or 
21
policy that addresses workplace violence, let alone 
22
domestic violence. In fact, only four percent of em-
23
ployers provided training on domestic violence. 
24
00:57 Mar 16, 2019

•HR 1468 IH
(12) Studies indicate that one of the best pre-
1
dictors of whether a survivor will be able to stay 
2
away from his or her abuser is the degree of his or 
3
her economic independence. However, domestic vio-
4
lence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking 
5
often negatively impact a survivor’s ability to main-
6
tain employment. 
7
(13) Abusers frequently seek to exert financial 
8
control over their partners by actively interfering 
9
with their ability to work, including preventing their 
10
partners from going to work, harassing their part-
11
ners at work, limiting their partners’ access to cash 
12
or transportation, and sabotaging their partners’ 
13
child care arrangements. 
14
(14) Economic abuse refers to behaviors that 
15
control an intimate partner’s ability to acquire, use, 
16
and maintain access to, money, credit, ownership of 
17
assets, or access to governmental or private financial 
18
benefits, including, to defaulting on joint obligations 
19
(e.g. school loans, credit card debt, mortgage, or 
20
rent). Other forms may include preventing someone 
21
from attending school, threatening to or actually ter-
22
minating employment, controlling or withholding ac-
23
cess to cash, checking, or credit accounts, attempts 
24
to damage or sabotage an intimate partner’s credit-

worthiness, including forcing a survivor to write bad 
1
checks, including forcing a survivor to default on 
2
payments related to household needs, such as hous-
3
ing, or forcing a survivor into bankruptcy. 
4
(15) The Patient Protection and Affordable 
5
Care Act (Public Law 111–148), and the amend-
6
ments made by such Act, ensures that most health 
7
plans must cover preventive services, including 
8
screening and counseling for domestic violence, at no 
9
additional cost. In addition, it prohibits insurance 
10
companies from discriminating against patients for 
11
preexisting conditions, like domestic violence. 
12
(16) Yet, more can be done to help survivors. 
13
Federal law in effect on the day before the date of 
14
enactment of this Act does not explicitly— 
15
(A) authorize survivors of domestic vio-
16
lence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalk-
17

18
ance and redress, counseling, or assistance with 
19

7

10
(E) prohibit insurers from disclosing infor-
11

12
vivors through insurance databases and other

14
(17) October is National Domestic Violence 
15
Awareness Month. 
16
(18) This Act aims to empower survivors of do-
17
mestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or 
18
stalking to be free from violence, hardship, and con-
19
trol, which restrains basic human rights to freedom 
20
