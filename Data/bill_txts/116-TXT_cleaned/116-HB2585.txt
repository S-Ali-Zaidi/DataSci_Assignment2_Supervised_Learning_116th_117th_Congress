To establish a Federal Advisory Council to Support Victims 
of Gun Violence. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In the United States, approximately 100 in-
8
dividuals are killed with guns every day, and more

than 36,000 individuals die from gun violence every 
1
year. Approximately 100,000 more individuals sur-
2
vive gun-related injuries every year. 
3
(2) The approximately 100,000 individuals who 
4
survive gun-related injuries every year in the United 
5
States face a life-long process of physical and emo-
6
tional healing, in addition to the heavy economic 
7
costs faced by those survivors, their families and 
8
communities, and society as a whole. According to a 
9
recent national poll, 4 percent of adults alive in the 
10
United States as of the date of the poll, or an esti-
11
mated 10,000,000 people, have been shot and in-
12
jured in their lifetimes. 
13
(3) Nearly two-thirds of gun-related deaths in 
14
the United States are suicides. Suicide attempts in-
15
volving firearms are uniquely lethal: while less than 
16
5 percent of suicide attempts not involving a firearm 
17
result in death, approximately 85 percent of suicide 
18
attempts involving a firearm end in death. According 
19
to a 2018 report by the Department of Veterans Af-
20
fairs, veterans are about 1.5 times as likely as civil-
21
ians to die by suicide, and 69.4 percent of veteran 
22
suicides in 2016 resulted from a firearm injury. 
23
(4) More than one-third of gun-related deaths 
24
in the United States are homicides, and in 2010, the 
25

•HR 2585 IH
gun homicide rate in the United States was 25.2 
1
times higher than in 22 other high-income countries. 
2
(5) Gun homicides in the United States occur 
3
disproportionately in cities, particularly in racially 
4
segregated neighborhoods with high rates of poverty. 
5
Gun homicide disproportionately affects communities 
6
of color, and Black Americans represent the major-
7
ity of gun homicide victims. 
8
(6) More than 325 mass shootings took place in 
9
the United States in 2018, and more than 1,900 
10
mass shootings have taken place since the shooting 
11
at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, 
12
Connecticut, in 2012. Fifty-four percent of mass 
13
shootings are related to domestic or family violence. 
14
(7) Firearms are the second leading cause of 
15
death for children and teenagers and the first lead-
16
ing cause of death for Black children and teenagers 
17
in the United States. Every year, nearly 3,000 chil-
18
dren and teenagers are shot and killed, and approxi-
19
mately 15,600 are shot and injured. 
20
(8) During an average year in the United 
21
States, more than 600 women are shot to death by 
22
an intimate partner, and many more women are shot 
23
and injured by an intimate partner. Nearly 
24
1,000,000 women in the United States who are alive

as of the date of enactment of this Act have been 
1
shot or shot at by an intimate partner, and approxi-
2
mately 4,500,000 women alive as of that date have 
3
been threatened with a gun by an intimate partner. 
4
(9) More than 10,300 violent hate crimes com-
5
mitted in the United States in an average year in-
6
volve a gun, or more than 28 each day. The vast 
7
majority of hate crimes are directed against commu-
8
nities of color, religious minorities, and lesbian, gay, 
9
bisexual, transgender, and queer (commonly known 
10
as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) people.
