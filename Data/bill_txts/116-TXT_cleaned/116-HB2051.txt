Federal Government in section 114 of the American 
1
Innovation and Competitiveness Act (Public Law 
2
114–329); 
3
(2) sustainable chemistry and materials trans-
4
formation is a key value contributor to business 
5
competitiveness across many industrial and con-
6
sumer sectors; 
7
(3) companies across hundreds of supply chains 
8
critical to the American economy are seeking to re-
9
duce costs and open new markets through innova-
10
tions in manufacturing and materials, and are in 
11
need of new innovations in chemistry, including sus-
12
tainable chemistry; 
13
(4) sustainable chemistry can improve the effi-
14
ciency with which natural resources are used to meet 
15
human needs for chemical products while avoiding 
16
environmental harm, reduce or eliminate the emis-
17
sions of and exposures to hazardous substances, 
18
minimize the use of resources, and benefit the econ-
19
omy, people, and the environment; and

(5) a recent report by the Government Account-
21
ability Office (GAO–18–307) found that the Federal 
22
Government could play an important role in helping
