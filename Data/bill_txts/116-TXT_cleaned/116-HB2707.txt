SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The United States and the Russian Federa-
3
tion signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Trea-
4
ty (the ‘‘New START Treaty’’) on April 8, 2010. 
5
(2) The United States Senate advised and con-
6
sented to the the treaty on December 22, 2010, by 
7
a vote of 71-26. 
8
(3) The Senate resolution advising and con-
9
senting to the ratification of the New START Trea-
10
ty states that ‘‘prior to the entry into force of the 
11
New START Treaty, the President shall certify to 
12
the Senate that. . .the United States will seek to 
13
initiate. . .not later than one year after the entry 
14
into force of the New START Treaty, negotiations 
15
with the Russian Federation on an agreement to ad-
16
dress the disparity between the non-strategic (tac-
17
tical) nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian 
18
Federation and of the United States’’. 
19
(4) The New START Treaty is due to expire in

21
(5) The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review states— 
22
(A) ‘‘While the United States has contin-
23
ued to reduce the number and salience of nu-
24
clear weapons, others, including Russia and 
25
China, have moved in the opposite direction.

Russia has expanded and improved its strategic 
1
and non-strategic nuclear forces. China’s mili-
2
tary modernization has resulted in an expanded 
3
nuclear force, with little to no transparency into 
4
its intentions.’’; 
5
(B) ‘‘Russia is developing and deploying 
6
new nuclear warheads and launchers. These ef-
7
forts include multiple upgrades for every leg of 
8
the Russian nuclear triad of strategic bombers, 
9
sea-based missiles, and landbased missiles. Rus-
10
sia is also developing at least two new inter-
11
continental range systems, a hypersonic glide 
12
vehicle, and a new intercontinental, nuclear- 
13
armed, nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous 
14
torpedo.’’; 
15
(C) ‘‘[Russia] is also building a large, di-
16
verse, and modern set of non-strategic systems 
17
that are dual-capable. . .These theater- and 
18
tactical-range systems are not accountable 
19
under the New START Treaty’’; 
20
(D) ‘‘China continues to increase the num-
21
ber, capabilities, and protection of its nuclear 
22
forces.’’; and 
23
(E) ‘‘China has developed a new road-mo-
24
bile strategic intercontinental ballistic missile

(ICBM), a new multi-warhead version of its 
1
DF5 silo-based ICBM, and its most advanced 
2
ballistic missile submarine armed with new sub-
3
marine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM). It 
4
has also announced development of a new nu-
5
clear-capable strategic bomber, giving China a 
6
nuclear triad.’’. 
7
(6) On April 4, 2019, President Donald J. 
8
Trump stated, ‘‘Between Russia and China and us, 
9
we’re all making hundreds of billions of dollars 
10
worth of weapons, including nuclear, which is ridicu-
11
lous. . .and I would say that China will come along, 
12
and I would say Russia will come along. It doesn’t 
13
really make sense that we’re doing this.’’. 
14
(7) In testimony before the Committee on For-
15
eign Relations of the Senate on April 10, 2019, Sec-
16
retary of State Mike Pompeo stated, in response to 
17
a question about extending the New START treaty, 
18
that ‘‘we need to make sure that we’ve got all of the 
19
parties that are relevant as a component of this as 
20
well’’. 
21
(8) On March 16, 2019, National Security Ad-
22
visor John Bolton stated, ‘‘China is building up its 
23
nuclear capacity now. It’s. . .one reason why if 
24
we’re going to have another arms control negotia-

tion, for example, with the Russians, it may make 
1
sense to include China in that discussion as well’’. 
2
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of Congress that— 
4
(1) arms control is beneficial for both United 
5
States national security and international stability, 
6
but the United States should not enter arms control 
7
agreements that impose unilateral restrictions on the 
8
United States Armed Forces and fail to properly ac-
9
count for the nuclear arsenals of all near-peer com-
10
petitors in the international system; and 
11
(2) any New START Treaty extension or suc-
12
cessor agreement must be a trilateral arrangement 
13
among the United States, the Russian Federation, 
14
and the People’s Republic of China. 
15
SEC. 4. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS. 
16
No funds shall be expended to implement a New 
17
START Treaty extension or any successor agreement un-
18

ment—
