RESOLUTION 
Condemning Turkey’s attacks on United States forces and 
allies and Turkey’s continued support for terrorist orga-
nizations. 
Whereas Turkey has been a North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO) member since 1952 and as such Turkey is 
obligated to adhere to the principles and mission of the 
North Atlantic Treaty; 
Whereas under the nearly two-decade long authoritarian rule 
of Recep Tayyip Erdog˘an, Turkey has eroded that rela-
tionship by— 
(1) implementing domestic policies that violate the 
founding principles of NATO to live in peace with all 
peoples and governments, and safeguard the freedom, 
common heritage, and civilization of their peoples, found-

ed on the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and 
the rule of law; and 
(2) taking deliberate hostile actions against NATO 
allies as well as aggressive actions that threaten regional 
stability, undermine United States security interests, and 
risk drawing NATO into a larger conflict of Turkey’s 
own creation; 
Whereas Turkey’s use of the S–400 air defense system on 
United States-made F–16 fighter jets returning from the 
Eunomia exercise conducted by France, Italy, Greece, 
and Cyprus in August of 2020 was an act of unwar-
ranted aggression on a NATO ally; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the Turkish Navy was found to be 
escorting a vessel suspected of shipping arms to Libya in 
violation of an arms embargo and that the Turkish Navy 
acted to prevent a French naval vessel from investigating 
the suspected vessel, prompting a NATO investigation; 
Whereas Turkey has threatened other allies in NATO and 
disregarded international law by sending a research ves-
sel and naval ships into Greek waters around the island 
of Kastellorizo on an oil exploration mission in waters 
that the United Nations, the European Union, and inter-
national law maintain are within the Greek Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ); 
Whereas the buildup of Turkish tanks in the Province of 
Erdine on the border between Greece and Turkey, and 
Turkey’s threatening rhetoric against Greece on state-run 
media, has further increased tensions between the Euro-
pean Union and Turkey; 
Whereas Turkey has provided indirect and direct military, 
economic, and political support to known terrorist organi-

zations such as the Islamic State and Al Qaeda-linked 
jihadist groups such as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) 
and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in northern Syria; 
Whereas, on October 11, 2019, Turkey deliberately attacked 
Kurdish forces with indirect fire, with full knowledge that 
United States special forces were co-located with them 
and that their artillery rounds could hit United States 
forces; 
Whereas this attack forced the withdrawal of United States 
troops from their observation post, whose exact location 
was known to the Turkish military; 
Whereas General Mark A. Milley, Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, said that because Turkey knew the exact 
location of United States troops, this was a deliberate 
show of force against the United States and its Syrian 
Democratic Forces (SDF) partners, as all artillery oper-
ated by the Turkish military would have United States 
locations programmed as No Fire Areas (NFAs); 
Whereas former American envoy for the anti-ISIS coalition 
Brett McGurk released statements supporting General 
Milley’s assertions; 
Whereas Turkey has continually undermined the efforts of 
the United States-supported Syrian Kurds by taking mili-
tary action against them, including— 
(1) heavy artillery attacks on Kurdish SDF in the 
Abu Rasin region of Al-Hasakah on September 23, 2019; 
(2) a bombardment of a Kurdish SDF outpost on 
October 8, 2019; and 
(3) an attempted assassination of a Kurdish SDF 
defense official near Ain al-Issa by an armed Turkish 
drone in August of 2020;

•HRES 1195 IH 
Whereas continued aggression by Turkey and its proxies 
against the SDF in northern Syria has led to a resur-
gence of ISIS and Al Qaeda, and further destabilization 
of the region; 
Whereas Turkey has sent between 3,500 and 3,800 paid Syr-
ian fighters with links to Al Qaeda and ISIS along with 
Turkish soldiers to Libya to fight in its civil war, under-
mining the peace and reconciliation process there and 
providing a haven for terrorist organizations; 
Whereas Turkey has escalated its involvement in the conflict 
between Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh, previously 
offering political support for Azerbaijan’s position, but 
now providing direct military support; 
Whereas Turkey maintains a closed border with the Republic 
of Armenia, a country with friendly relations with the 
United States, and has repeatedly issued threats against 
the Republic of Armenia, Nagorno Karabakh, and Arme-
nian communities in other parts of the world, at times 
thinly veiling its threats with references to the genocide 
of Armenians in Turkey that took place in the early 20th 
century; 
Whereas reports indicate that Turkey has sent Syrian fight-
ers, many of whom have been associated with Al Qaeda 
and ISIS, to fight against the Armenians of Nagorno 
Karabakh; 
Whereas it has been reported that Turkey has participated in 
or taken outright control of Azerbaijan’s air command 
and military offensive against Nagorno Karabakh and 
that its F–16 fighters have been engaged in attacks 
against both Nagorno Karabakh and the Republic of Ar-
menia;

Whereas NATO has called for the immediate cease-fire to 
hostilities in Nagorno Karabakh in response to Azer-
baijan’s military attack on Nagorno Karabakh while Tur-
key has contradicted NATO’s position by publicly sup-
porting and assisting with Azerbaijan’s continued mili-
tary aggression; 
Whereas in response to Canada’s decision to suspend arms 
exports to Turkey in response to its involvement in Azer-
baijan’s military offensive, Turkey cited the NATO rela-
tionship as the reason for its disappointment in Canada’s 
decision, associating NATO with its actions in the 
Caucasus; and 
Whereas this conflict threatens to draw Russia into the con-
flict, as they have a mutual defense agreement with Ar-
menia, therefore heightening the possibility of NATO in-
volvement should Turkey invoke Article 5 of the North 
Atlantic Treaty: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) strongly condemns Turkey’s attacks on 
2
United States forces, allies, and partners including 
3
the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces; 
4
(2) demands the end of Turkey’s support of ter-
5
rorist groups such as ISIS, Al Qaeda, and others; 
6
and 
7
(3) calls on the President to work with NATO 
8
to create the necessary process to remove Turkey

from NATO.
