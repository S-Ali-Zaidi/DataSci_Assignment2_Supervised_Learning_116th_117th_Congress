RESOLUTION 
Opposing efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and the 
Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement 
targeting Israel. 
Whereas the democratic, Jewish State of Israel is a key ally 
and strategic partner of the United States; 
Whereas since Israel’s founding in 1948, Congress has re-
peatedly expressed our Nation’s unwavering commitment 
to the security of Israel as a Jewish and democratic 
state; 
Whereas American policy has long sought to bring peace to 
the Middle East and recognized that both the Israeli and

Palestinian people should be able to live in safe and sov-
ereign states, free from fear and violence, with mutual 
recognition; 
Whereas support for peace between the Israelis and Palestin-
ians has long-standing bipartisan support in Congress; 
Whereas it is the long-standing policy of the United States 
that a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict should come through direct negotiations between the 
Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with 
the support of countries in the region and around the 
world; 
Whereas it is a hallmark of American democracy for citizens 
to petition the United States Government in favor of or 
against United States foreign policy; 
Whereas cooperation between Israel and the United States is 
of great importance, especially in the context of rising 
anti-Semitism, authoritarianism and security problems in 
Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa; 
Whereas the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions 
Movement (BDS Movement) targeting Israel is a cam-
paign that does not favor a two-state solution and that 
seeks to exclude the State of Israel and the Israeli people 
from the economic, cultural, and academic life of the rest 
of the world; 
Whereas the BDS Movement targets not only the Israeli gov-
ernment but also Israeli academic, cultural, and civil soci-
ety institutions, as well as individual Israeli citizens of all 
political persuasions, religions, and ethnicities, and in 
some cases even Jews of other nationalities who support 
Israel;

Whereas the BDS Movement does not recognize, and many 
of its supporters explicitly deny, the right of the Jewish 
people to national self-determination; 
Whereas a founder of the BDS Movement has denied the 
right of the Jewish people in their homeland, saying, ‘‘We 
oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Pales-
tinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, 
will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine.’’; 
Whereas university-based BDS efforts violate the core goals 
of the university and global cultural development, which 
thrive on free and open exchange and debate; and 
Whereas the BDS Movement promotes principles of collective 
guilt, mass punishment, and group isolation, which are 
destructive of prospects for progress towards peace and 
a two-state solution: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) opposes the Global Boycott, Divestment, 
2
and Sanctions Movement (BDS Movement) tar-
3
geting Israel, including efforts to target United 
4
States companies that are engaged in commercial 
5
activities that are legal under United States law, and 
6
all efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel; 
7
(2) affirms that the Global Boycott, Divest-
8
ment, and Sanctions Movement undermines the pos-
9
sibility for a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Pales-
10
tinian conflict by demanding concessions of one 
11
party alone and encouraging the Palestinians to re-
12
ject negotiations in favor of international pressure;

(3) urges Israelis and Palestinians to return to 
1
direct negotiations as the only way to achieve an end

to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; 
3
(4) supports the full implementation of the 
4
United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of

2014 (Public Law 113–296; 128 Stat. 4075) and

new efforts to enhance government-wide, coordinated

United States-Israel scientific and technological co-
8
operation in civilian areas, such as with respect to 
9
energy, water, agriculture, alternative fuel tech-
10
nology, civilian space technology, and security, in 
11
order to counter the effects of actions to boycott, di-
12
vest from, or sanction Israel; and 
13
(5) reaffirms its strong support for a negotiated 
14
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting 
15
in two states—a democratic Jewish State of Israel, 
16
and a viable, democratic Palestinian state—living 
17
side-by-side in peace, security, and mutual recogni-

tion.
