Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Berta Ca´ceres Human 
4
Rights in Honduras Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Honduran police are widely established 
8
to be deeply corrupt and commit human rights 
9
abuses, including torture, rape, illegal detention, and 
10
murder, with impunity. 
11
(2) The New York Times revealed documents 
12
on April 15, 2016, indicating that top officials of the 
13
Honduran police ordered the killings of drug-crime 
14
investigators Julia´n Arı´stides Gonza´les and Alfredo 
15
Landaverde in 2009 and 2011, respectively, with the 
16
subsequent knowledge of top police and, evidently, 
17
high-ranking government officials. The Times sug-
18
gested in a subsequent article that the revelations 
19
were being manipulated by the President of Hon-
20
duras for his own corrupt purposes. Both cases re-
21
main in impunity. 
22
(3) Individuals in the police with documented 
23
records of having committed gross human rights 
24
abuses with impunity continue to serve in, and be 
25

•HR 1945 IH
appointed and reappointed to high positions with the 
1
police. Former general in the Armed Forces Julian 
2
Pacheco Tinoco, the Minister of Security, was the 
3
highest ranking official in charge of the repression 
4
of protesters by the police following the November 
5
27, 2017, election, and has been twice named in 
6
United States Federal court as overseeing drug traf-
7
ficking. He was reappointed to his position by Presi-
8
dent Juan Orlando Herna´ndez in December 2018. 
9
(4) Other individuals who previously served in 
10
high-ranking positions and who are documented to 
11
have committed gross human rights abuses continue 
12
in impunity. 
13
(5) International human rights bodies have re-
14
ported that the Honduran military and police com-
15
mit human rights abuses, including killings, with im-
16
punity. The Associated Press has documented death 
17
squad activity by police. Human Rights Watch has 
18
reported: ‘‘The use of lethal force by the national po-
19
lice is a chronic problem.’’. In its report for 2018 it 
20
concluded that ‘‘Violent crime is rampant in Hon-
21
duras’’. It noted that: ‘‘Marred by corruption and 
22
abuse, the judiciary and police remain largely inef-
23
fective. Impunity for crime and human rights abuses 
24
is the norm.’’.

(6) The Department of State’s 2018 Human 
1
Rights Report for Honduras reported: ‘‘Civilian au-
2
thorities at times did not maintain effective control 
3
over the security forces.’’. It summarized: ‘‘The most 
4
significant human rights issues included alleged ar-
5
bitrary and unlawful killings; a complaint of torture; 
6
harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbi-
7
trary arrest or detention; unlawful interference with 
8
privacy; killings of and threats to media members,’’ 
9
and other issues. 
10
(7) Repeated efforts to clean up the Honduran 
11
police have largely failed. A recent commission 
12
charged with cleaning up the police reports that it 
13
has cleaned up over 5,000 members, but the great 
14
majority of those were separated for reasons of re-
15
structuring, retirements, or disabilities. Only ap-
16
proximately 100 cases of alleged criminal activity 
17
have been forwarded to the Public Ministry for pros-
18
ecution. Few of those are being prosecuted. The ac-
19
tions and results of the police cleanup commission 
20
have not been independently verified, moreover, and 
21
its directors include Julian Pacheco Tinoco, the Min-
22
ister of Security, named as a drug trafficker, and 
23
Vilma Morales, one of the top two negotiators for 
24
06:33 Apr 11, 2019
H1945

•HR 1945 IH
the leader of the 2009 coup. Long-lasting, funda-
1
mental reform of the police still needs to be enacted. 
2
(8) Evidence indicates that topmost officials in 
3
charge of the police have been allegedly involved in 
4
drug trafficking. The National Director of the Police 
5
and his top two lieutenants have been documented 
6
by the Associated Press to have previously partici-
7
pated in cocaine trafficking. Julian Pacheco Tinoco, 
8
the Minister of Security, reappointed in December 
9
2018, has been twice named in United States Fed-
10
eral court as overseeing drug trafficking. 
11
(9) Rights Action has documented that the Fif-
12
teenth Battalion of the Honduran Armed Forces al-
13
legedly participated with police and private security 
14
forces in some of the killings of over 100 small-farm-
15
er activists in the Agua´n Valley beginning in 2010. 
16
In 2015, Human Rights Watch confirmed that the 
17
killings of Agua´n farmers were met with no con-
18
sequences. To date there has been one confirmed 
19
conviction of a private security guard. Assassinations 
20
of key activists continue. In October 2016, Jose´ 
21
Angel 
Flores, 
the 
president 
of 
the 
Unified 
22
Campesino Movement of the Agua´n (MUCA), and 
23
Silmer Dionisio George, another MUCA member, 
24
were assassinated, with impunity.

(10) Further examples abound of human rights 
1
abuses by the military: in July 2013 members of the 
2
Armed Forces shot and killed Toma´s Garcı´a, a 
3
Lenca Indigenous activist, and injured his son while 
4
they were peacefully protesting a dam project; in 
5
May 2014, nine members of the Ninth Infantry re-
6
portedly tortured and killed Amado Maradiaga 
7
Quiroz and tortured his son, Milton Noe Maradiaga 
8
Varela. The cases remain in impunity. In an em-
9
blematic case, on December 27, 2015, the Honduran 
10
Navy reportedly killed Joel Palacios Lino and Elvis 
11
Armando Garcı´a, two Garı´funa Afro-Indigenous men 
12
who were engaged in digging a car out of the sand 
13
on a beach. Ten members of the Honduran military 
14
were convicted of the killing of these 2 men, under-
15
scoring that egregious human rights are committed 
16
by state security forces. 
17
(11) The current Government of Honduras has 
18
expanded the military’s reach into domestic policing, 
19
including the creation of a 4,300-member Military 
20
Police in clear violation of the Honduran constitu-
21
tion and with disastrous results, including the 
22
killings of a 15-year-old boy, Ebed Yanes, in 2012 
23
and a student, Erlin Misael Carı´as Moncada, in 
24
2014, after they had passed unarmed through check-
25

•HR 1945 IH
points, and the January 2, 2017, killing of 17-year- 
1
old Edgardo Moreno Rodriquez. While one member 
2
of the armed forces was convicted and sentenced in 
3
the case of Yanes, the case of the United States- 
4
trained colonel who allegedly subsequently ordered a 
5
cover-up remains in impunity. Since the creation of 
6
the Military Police, ‘‘allegations of human rights 
7
abuses by the military have increased notably’’, re-
8
ports Human Rights Watch. The Military Police 
9
now count 9 battalions and plan 2 additional battal-
10
ions. 
11
(12) During the crisis that erupted following 
12
the highly contested November 2017 Presidential 
13
election, massive protests against electoral fraud and 
14
the disputed re-election campaign of President Juan 
15
Orlando Herna´ndez emerged throughout the coun-
16
try. The United Nations and the Committee of Fam-
17
ilies of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras 
18
(COFADEH) have documented that in response, 
19
Honduran state security forces killed at least 16 
20
people, many of them protesters and bystanders; one 
21
additional person remains forcibly disappeared by 
22
state security forces. The great majority of the vic-
23
tims, according to the UN and COFADEH reports, 
24
were killed by the Military Police. All these cases re-
25
03:27 Apr 12, 2019
H1945

•HR 1945 IH
main in impunity. In addition, 3 people accused of 
1
crimes while protesting remain in prison awaiting 
2
trial under dire, life-threatening conditions and a 
3
fourth remains in exile. 
4
(13) The Military Police continue to commit se-
5
rious human rights abuses. On November 30, 2017, 
6
Daniel Isaac Varela, age 12, was wounded by mem-
7
bers of the military police in Comayagu¨ela during a 
8
post-election demonstration while he was purchasing 
9
candy with friends and the military opened fire. On 
10
December 3, 2017, Manuel de Jesu´s Bautista Sal-
11
vador disappeared while held in detention by the 
12
Military Police in Cofradı´a, Corte´s, and his where-
13
abouts remain unknown. 
14
(14) The Honduran judicial system has been 
15
widely documented to be rife with corruption. 
16
Judges, prosecutors, and other officials are inter-
17
connected with organized crime and drug traffickers, 
18
contributing to near-complete impunity. 
19
(15) The Department of State in its 2018 
20
Human Rights Report for Honduras reports that 
21
‘‘Corruption and impunity remained serious prob-
22
lems within the security forces.’’. It noted that ‘‘Im-
23
punity existed in many cases . . . as evidenced by 
24
lengthy judicial processes, few convictions of per-
25
03:27 Apr 12, 2019
H1945
9 
•HR 1945 IH
petrators, and failures to prosecute intellectual au-
1
thors of crimes.’’. 
2
(16) Overall, the judicial system remains inef-
3
fective and corrupt. The Department of State re-
4
ported for 2017 that it was ‘‘often ineffective, and 
5
subject to intimidation, corruption, politicization and 
6
patronage . . . Powerful special interests, including 
7
organized crime groups, exercised influence on the 
8
outcome of some court proceedings.’’. 
9
(17) Summarizing the situation, Human Rights 
10
Watch reported for 2018 that ‘‘Judges face inter-
11
ference from the executive branch and others, in-
12
cluding private actors with connections in govern-
13
ment.’’. It concludes: ‘‘Efforts to reform the institu-
14
tions responsible for providing public security have 
15
made little progress. Married by corruption and 
16
abuse, the judiciary and police remain largely inef-
17
fective.’’. 
18
(18) The March 2, 2016, assassination of 
19
prominent Lenca Indigenous and environmental ac-
20
tivist Berta Ca´ceres, world-renowned recipient of the 
21
2015 Goldman Environmental Prize for her work 
22
defending Indigenous land rights against a hydro-
23
electric dam project, illustrates the human rights cri-
24
sis in Honduras, and the deep complicity of the 
25
06:33 Apr 11, 2019
H1945
10 
•HR 1945 IH
Honduran government. Ca´ceres, the leader of 
1
COPINH, the Council of Indigenous and Popular 
2
Organizations of Honduras, had reported to authori-
3
ties 33 threats previous to her killing, but none had 
4
been investigated, and the government had failed to 
5
provide adequate protection measures as mandated 
6
by the Inter-American Commission on Human 
7
Rights, with protection by Honduran security being 
8
withdrawn the day of her death. 
9
(19) As of November 2018, seven men have 
10
been convicted in the killing of Ca´ceres. One of them 
11
was an active duty officer in the military at the time 
12
of his arrest and two others are former military. A 
13
third former officer and the president of the DESA 
14
Corporation, the dam construction company, has 
15
been charged and is awaiting trial. The convictions 
16
raise serious questions about the role of the Hon-
17
duran military in her assassination, including the 
18
higher chain of command within the military as well 
19
as the identity of the intellectual authors of the as-
20
sassination. Evidence in the documents in the case 
21
file indicate that members of the Honduran elite 
22
were responsible for ordering Ca´ceres’s assassina-
23
tion, and remain in impunity. Evidence also indi-
24
cates possible involvement of individuals of higher 
25
03:27 Apr 12, 2019
H1945
11 
•HR 1945 IH
rank in the military, but there is no indication that 
1
prosecutors are investigating these individuals. 
2
(20) The Government of Honduras continues to 
3
unduly limit legally mandated access by Ms. 
4
Ca´ceres’s family to participation in the prosecution 
5
as permitted under Honduran law. 
6
(21) In this context of corruption and human 
7
rights abuses, trade unionists, journalists, lawyers, 
8
Afro-Indigenous 
activists, 
Indigenous 
activists, 
9
small-farmer activists, LGBTI activists, human 
10
rights defenders, and critics of the government re-
11
main at severe risk; and previous human rights 
12
abuses against them remain largely unpunished. 
13
(22) Journalists continue to be attacked with 
14
impunity. On May 2, 2016, prominent opposition 
15
journalist Fe´lix Molina was shot multiple times in 
16
the legs hours after he had posted information po-
17
tentially linking Ca´ceres’s killing to a top govern-
18
ment official, members of an elite family, and one of 
19
the prosecutors in the case. Those who report on 
20
protests against the government are threatened and 
21
attacked by state security forces. On November 26, 
22
2018, journalist Geovanny Sierra from the UNETV 
23
opposition television station was in the process of re-
24
porting on the repression by security forces of a pro-

test marking the one-year anniversary of the dis-
1
puted 2017 elections when he was fired upon by 
2
members of the police assigned to the National Peni-
3
tentiary. He survived the attack but suffered exten-
4
sive injuries to his right arm. Both cases remain in 
5
impunity. 
6
(23) United States agencies allocated approxi-
7
mately $39 million that Congress appropriated 
8
through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, 
9
to the Honduran police and military for fiscal year 
10
2017. 
11
(24) The Inter-American Development Bank 
12
lent $60,000,000 to the Honduran police between 
13
2012 and 2018, with United States approval.

small-farmers, LGBTI activists, critics of the gov-
13
ernment, and other civil society activists to operate 
14
without interference; and 
15
(5) taken effective steps to fully establish the 
16
rule of law and to guarantee a judicial system that 
17
is capable of investigating, prosecuting, and bringing 
18
to justice members of the police and military who 
19
have committed human rights abuses.
