SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
1
It is the policy of the United States to address 
2
proactively threats to food security in the East Africa re-
3
gion and elsewhere, as well as the concomitant potential 
4
for political instability, caused by periodic locust out-
5
breaks, and to promote resilience in affected countries. 
6
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The United States Agency for International 
9
Development reports that the East Africa region is 
10
currently suffering the worst locust outbreaks in 
11
decades, which will devour crops and pasture across 
12
that region. 
13
(2) As of June 2020, there were more than 26 
14
million people experiencing acute food insecurity in 
15
Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, 
16
Uganda, Sudan, and Djibouti, and untold more will 
17
be at risk if the locusts are not controlled. 
18
(3) The World Food Programme reports that 
19
there may be insufficient resources to conduct aerial 
20
spraying to address the locust outbreaks that are 
21
currently devastating the East Africa region, and 
22
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organiza-
23
tion warns that the current outbreaks could develop 
24
into a plague by the end of 2020 if they are not con-
25
trolled.

•HR 7276 IH
(4) The locust outbreaks in the Horn of Africa 
1
region, particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Soma-
2
lia, represents an unprecedented threat to food secu-
3
rity and livelihoods, and potentially, by extension, 
4
political stability in the region. 
5
(5) A relatively small investment now to help 
6
eradicate the locust outbreaks will obviate or amelio-
7
rate the need for a much larger United States emer-
8
gency food aid effort later, as well as help promote 
9
political stability and build resilience. 
10
(6) In order to optimize a United States re-
11
sponse to the locust outbreaks and future outbreaks, 
12
it is necessary to establish an interagency working 
13
group to develop and implement a comprehensive, 
14
strategic plan to eradicate locust outbreaks in the 
15
East Africa region and address future outbreaks. 
16
SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP. 
17
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established an inter-
18
agency working group to develop a comprehensive, stra-
19
tegic plan to eradicate locust outbreaks in the East Africa 
20
region and address future outbreaks in order to avert 
21
mass scale food insecurity and potential political desta-
22
bilization.
