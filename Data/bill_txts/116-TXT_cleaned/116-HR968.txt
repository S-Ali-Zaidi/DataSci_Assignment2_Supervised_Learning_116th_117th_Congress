RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the essential role of public safety telecommunica-
tors in emergency response and the important work per-
formed by public safety telecommunicators to protect 
the public and police, fire, and emergency medical offi-
cials during emergencies, such as the Coronavirus Dis-
ease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic. 
Whereas public safety telecommunicators play a critical role

and actions taken by public safety telecommunicators 
form the foundation for an effective response; 
Whereas the first contact that a hostage taker or a suicidal 
person makes when that person calls 9–1–1 is with a 
public safety telecommunicator, whose negotiation skills 
can prevent the situation from getting worse; 
Whereas, during active shooter incidents, public safety tele-
communicators coach callers through first aid and give 
advice to prevent further harm, all while collecting vital 
information to provide situational awareness for respond-
ing officers; 
Whereas the work of public safety telecommunicators comes 
with an extreme emotional and physical impact that is 
compounded by long hours and the around-the-clock na-
ture of the job; 
Whereas public safety telecommunicators should be recog-
nized by all levels of government for the lifesaving and 
protective nature of the work that public safety tele-
communicators perform; and 
Whereas major emergencies, such as the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, highlight the dedication of 
public safety telecommunicators and the important work 
performed by public safety telecommunicators to protect 
the public and police, fire, and emergency medical offi-
cials: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—
