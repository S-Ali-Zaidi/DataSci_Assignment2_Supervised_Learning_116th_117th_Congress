Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Honor Our Commit-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) From April–September 1975, the United 
8
States conducted Operation New Arrival to relocate

130,000 Vietnamese refugees to the United States 
1
following the end of the Vietnam War. 
2
(2) During this time, more than 50,000 Viet-
3
namese refugees were processed through Camp Pen-
4
dleton for Southern California. 
5
(3) In the 4 decades since refugees fled Viet-
6
nam, Vietnamese Americans have weaved their sto-
7
ries into the American fabric. 
8
(4) The biggest concentration of Vietnamese 
9
American is in Orange County, California, followed 
10
by San Jose (California), Houston (Texas), Seattle 
11
(Washington), Northern Virginia, and New Orleans 
12
(Louisiana). 
13
(5) According to the 2010 census, Vietnamese 
14
is the 6th most commonly spoken language in the 
15
United States. 
16
(6) Immigrant communities face significant 
17
problems assimilating as a result of the trauma of 
18
war. A 2018 study published by Rashmi Gangamma 
19
and Daran Shipman in the Journal of Marital and 
20
Family Therapy noted that ‘‘the traumatic nature of 
21
(immigrant’s) forced displacement flight, and reset-
22
tlement can increase vulnerability to mental dis-
23
tress.’’. First generation immigrants are especially 
24
vulnerable to gang violence within communities in

which their parents cannot guide with cultural or po-
1
litical comfortability. 
2
(7) In 2008, the United States and Vietnam 
3
signed a bilateral repatriation agreement, hereafter 
4
known as the 2008 Vietnam-U.S. Memorandum of 
5
Understanding (MOU). 
6
(8) According to Section 2, Article 2 of the 
7
2008 Vietnam-U.S. MOU, ‘‘Vietnamese citizens are 
8
not subject to return to Vietnam under this Agree-
9
ment if they arrived in the United States before July 
10
12, 1995, the date on which diplomatic relations 
11
were re-established between the U.S. Government 
12
and the Vietnamese Government. The U.S. Govern-
13
ment and the Vietnamese Government maintain 
14
their respective legal positions relative to Vietnamese 
15
citizens who departed Vietnam for the United States 
16
prior to that date’’. 
17
(9) The United States under President George 
18
Bush and President Barack Obama recognized the 
19
2008 Vietnam-U.S. MOU’s protection for pre-1995 
20
refugees from deportation. 
21
(10) In 2019, President Trump’s Administra-
22
tion began to renegotiate the 2008 Vietnam-U.S. 
23
MOU to expand the categories of immigrants it 
24
could deport, including permanent residents who

have committed certain minor crimes and others who 
1
came to the United States as children after the Viet-
2
nam War. 
3
(11) In February 2018, Asian Americans Ad-
4
vancing Justice’s Asian Law Caucus in San Fran-
5
cisco, Los Angeles, and Atlanta filed a class action 
6
lawsuit in the name of Orange County resident 
7
Hoang Trinh and six other refugees who all came to 
8
the U.S. before the 1995 date and became legal per-
9
manent residents. Due to criminal convictions, they 
10
all lost their green cards, making them subject to 
11
deportation. Under the 2008 Vietnam-U.S. MOU, 
12
they should be protected from deportation. The refu-
13
gees were held in prolonged detention in violation of 
14
a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision restricting 
15
overlong detention. 
16
(12) In August 2018, U.S. District Judge 
17
Cormac Carney ruled that the plaintiffs in the class 
18
action presented a plausible claim that the govern-
19
ment is now not abiding by a ‘‘longstanding practice 
20
of not removing pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants 
21
and by the 2008 diplomatic agreement.’’.
