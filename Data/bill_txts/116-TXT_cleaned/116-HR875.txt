RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
domain name registration information, referred to as 
‘‘WHOIS’’ information, is critical to the protection of 
the United States national and economic security, intel-
lectual property rights enforcement, cybersecurity, as well 
as the health, safety, and privacy of its citizens, and 
should remain readily accessible. 
Whereas WHOIS information is the information regarding 
who is behind a domain name registration; 
Whereas WHOIS information has been widely available since 
before the dawn of the commercial internet;

Whereas law enforcement, public interest groups, and the pri-
vate sector use WHOIS information to help identify those 
individuals behind websites engaged in illegal and mali-
cious activity; 
Whereas law enforcement, public interest groups, and the pri-
vate sector use WHOIS information to make connections 
among websites that have similar or identical registration 
information to help identify patterns of illicit activity and 
prevent additional harm; 
Whereas law enforcement, public interest groups, and the pri-
vate sector use WHOIS information to aid consumer pro-
tection on the internet, protect privacy, combat illegal on-
line drug sales, enforce intellectual property laws, identify 
and stop human, sex, and animal trafficking, as well as 
in the defense of homeland and national security; 
Whereas the multistakeholder community continues to work 
diligently to create a service that both provides access to 
domain registrant information for legitimate, lawful 
needs and complies with privacy laws; 
Whereas the National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (NTIA) requires that registries and reg-
istrars managing the United States top-level domain 
‘‘maintain publicly accessible accurate WHOIS’’; and 
Whereas the NTIA identified WHOIS information as a ‘‘crit-
ical tool’’ in its April 2019 letter to the Internet Corpora-
tion for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and en-
couraged the swift creation of a system that allows for 
continued access to WHOIS data for parties with legiti-
mate interests, like law enforcement, public interest 
groups, intellectual property rights holders, and cyberse-
curity researchers: Now, therefore, be it
