RESOLUTION 
Expressing the continued commitment of the House of Rep-
resentatives to condemn and prevent the use of sexual 
and gender-based violence in armed conflict as a weapon 
of war and fully implement the Women, Peace, and Secu-
rity Agenda. 
Whereas, in April 2019, the Republic of Germany submitted 
a draft version of United Nations Security Council Reso-
lution 2467, reaffirming its commitment to the continu-
ation and full implementation of resolutions 1325 (2000), 
1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009), 1960 (2010), 
2106 (2013), 2122 (2013), and 2242 (2015) on women, 
peace, and security; 
Whereas, as reported by the Guardian and other news out-
lets, the United States delegation opposed the original

•HRES 894 IH 
draft language on the grounds that ambiguity in the lan-
guage could be interpreted as supporting abortion, and 
threatened to veto the resolution unless the paragraph 
was eliminated entirely; 
Whereas this is not the first instance in which the Trump ad-
ministration has attempted to dilute human rights lan-
guage and reporting related to reproductive health; 
Whereas the resolution was intended to be a declaration of 
global opposition to the use of sexual and gender-based 
violence in armed conflict; 
Whereas the resolution was intended to strengthen the 
Women, Peace, and Security Agenda in the lead up to 
October 2020, the 20th anniversary of United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on women, 
peace, and security, which recognized the disproportional 
impact that armed conflict has had on women and girls 
and called for the inclusion of a gender perspective in 
conflict resolution; 
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 
was the first recommendation by the United Nations Se-
curity Council to parties involved in an armed conflict to 
prevent the use of sexual and gender-based violence in 
armed conflict as well as ensure the inclusion of women 
in peace negotiations and postconflict reconstruction; 
Whereas the initial draft resolution submitted by Germany in 
April 2019 urged ‘‘United Nations entities and donors to 
provide nondiscriminatory and comprehensive health serv-
ices, including sexual and reproductive health, psycho-
social, legal, and livelihood support and other multisec-
toral services for survivors of sexual violence, taking into 
account the specific needs of persons with disabilities.’’;

•HRES 894 IH 
Whereas the language included in the initial draft resolution 
was previously agreed by consensus in the United Na-
tions Security Council and was intended to send a clear 
message of the need to support survivors and that the 
use of rape as a weapon of war is not condoned by the 
global community; 
Whereas the inclusion of reproductive health care data as an 
indicator of a broader human rights assessment signals 
the purposeful inclusion of women and girls, as well as 
their health, in the global human rights conversation; 
Whereas, in spring 2019, for the second year in a row, the 
Trump administration omitted data on reproductive 
health care previously included in the Department of 
State’s annual report on human rights globally; 
Whereas, in September 2019, the United States led a joint 
statement delivered at the United Nations High-Level 
Meeting on Universal Health Coverage attacking sexual 
and reproductive health and rights, misrepresenting the 
term as an attack on ‘‘the family’’; 
Whereas women’s security has been a priority of the House 
of Representatives of the 116th Congress, having recently 
reintroduced the International Violence Against Women 
Act; 
Whereas the work of human rights defenders, including 
women human rights defenders, in promoting civil, polit-
ical, economic, social, and cultural rights positively im-
pacts the lives of women and girls around the world; 
Whereas women human rights defenders are at risk of and 
suffer from violations and abuses, including systematic 
violations and abuses of their fundamental rights to life, 
liberty, and security of person, to psychological and phys-

ical integrity, to privacy and respect for private and fam-
ily life, and to freedom of opinion and expression, asso-
ciation, and peaceful assembly, and in addition these de-
fenders can experience gender-based violence, rape, and 
other forms of sexual violence, harassment, and verbal 
abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, by 
state actors, including law enforcement personnel and se-
curity forces, and nonstate actors, such as those related 
to family and community, in both public and private 
spheres; 
Whereas historical and structural inequalities in power rela-
tions and discrimination against women, as well as var-
ious forms of extremism, have direct implications for the 
status and treatment of women; and 
Whereas, as documented in the United Nations Declaration 
on Human Rights Defenders, the rights of women human 
rights defenders, including those working on sexual and 
reproductive health and rights, have been violated or 
abused and their work stigmatized owing to discrimina-
tory practices and social norms or patterns that serve to 
condone violence against women or perpetuate practices 
involving such violence: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
