(2) President George Washington, in a letter to 
1
William Moultrie dated August 28, 1793, wrote that 
2
‘‘[t]he constitution vests the power of declaring war 
3
in Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of im-
4
portance can be undertaken until after they shall 
5
have deliberated upon the subject and authorized 
6
such a measure’’. 
7
(3) Alexander Hamilton wrote in Examination 
8
Number 1 of the Hamilton Papers, dated December 
9
17, 1801, that ‘‘ ‘[t]he Congress shall have the 
10
power to declare war’; the plain meaning of which is, 
11
that it is the peculiar and exclusive duty of Con-
12
gress, when the nation is at peace, to change that 
13
state into a state of war’’. 
14
(4) Iran is the leading state sponsor of ter-
15
rorism in the Middle East and a pernicious trouble-
16
maker in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
17
(5) Missile tests by Iran have led to escalating 
18
tensions with Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United 
19
States, and the United Nations. 
20
(6) Iran has threatened to shutdown crucial 
21
maritime lines of communication, putting United 
22
States and international naval assets, as well as 
23
global energy assets, at risk.

(7) Since 1979, Iran has been ruled by Islamic 
1
theocrats who use the Quran to justify the suppres-
2
sion of domestic political freedom and the denial of 
3
civil and human rights. 
4
(8) A war with Iran would also endanger 
5
United States assets, personnel, and foreign policy 
6
objectives throughout the region, including in Iraq, 
7
Afghanistan, and Israel.

(9) On June 22, 2018, President Trump 
9
tweeted that Iran ‘‘[w]ill suffer consequences the 
10
likes of which few throughout history have ever suf-
11
fered before’’. 
12
(10) A May 5, 2019, statement from National 
13
Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton said that 
14
any attack on America or its allies, by Iran or its 
15
proxies, ‘‘will be met with unrelenting force’’. 
16
(11) Loose talk of war and belligerent rhetoric 
17
increases the risk of miscalculation by either side 
18
and unsettles United States allies.
