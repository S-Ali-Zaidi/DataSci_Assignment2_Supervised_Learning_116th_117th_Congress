Whereas, on June 25, 1991, the Republic of Slovenia de-

Whereas, on April 7, 1992, the United States recognized the 
independence of Slovenia, which was followed by the es-
tablishment of diplomatic relations on August 11, 1992; 
Whereas Slovenia has made important contributions to inter-
national efforts to promote peace, stability, and develop-
ment in Europe, the Middle East and the Near East, Af-
rica, and elsewhere; 
Whereas Slovenia has been an important United States ally 
in Central Europe and a strong advocate of democracy, 
human rights, the rule of law, and the merits of an open 
and free market economy; 
Whereas Central Europe is a critical geographic region for 
United States, North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO), and European Union (EU) interests; 
Whereas China and the Russian Federation have made con-
certed efforts to exert influence on our Central European 
allies and partners to drive a wedge between these na-
tions and the rest of NATO and the EU; 
Whereas Slovenia has become an active member country of 
international organizations, including the United Nations, 
NATO, the EU, the Organization for Economic Coopera-
tion and Development, the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the 
World Trade Organization; 
Whereas Slovenia has further strengthened its international 
role by successfully chairing the Organization for Secu-
rity and Cooperation in Europe in 2005, and, as the first 
new member from Central and Eastern Europe, by suc-
cessfully holding the presidency of the Council of the Eu-
ropean Union in 2008, when it also hosted a summit be-

tween the United States and the European Union at-
tended by President George W. Bush; 
Whereas Slovenia will hold the presidency of the Council of 
the European Union again in 2021; 
Whereas Slovenia actively participates in numerous regional 
forums with strong transatlantic interest, notably the 
Three Seas Initiative and the Partnership for Trans-
atlantic Energy Cooperation; 
Whereas almost a decade has passed since the last visit of 
the Prime Minister of Slovenia to the White House and 
a new interaction at this level is therefore urgently need-
ed; and 
Whereas, on March 3, 2020, Janez Jansˇa was elected as the 
14th Prime Minister of Slovenia and has not yet met 
with the President of the United States to further polit-
ical, trade, and military relationships: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives here-
