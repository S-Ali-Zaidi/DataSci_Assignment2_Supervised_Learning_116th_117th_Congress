RESOLUTION 
Supporting efforts to strengthen democracy in Hungary and 
its alliance with the United States. 
Whereas 2019 is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the 
30th anniversary of historic transitions in Hungary, in-
cluding the dismantling of the one-party Communist re-
gime and the barbed wire fences that separated Hungary 
from its neighbors; 
Whereas 2019 is also the 75th anniversary of the deportation 
by Hungarian authorities of 437,402 Hungarian Jews on 
147 trains in just 56 days between May 15 and July 9, 
1944, which was preceded by the passage of anti-Jewish

laws beginning in 1920 and the deportation of more than 
20,000 Jews in 1941; 
Whereas the United States and Hungary have a shared his-
tory dating to the times of 19th century Hungarian 
statesman Lajos Kossuth, whose bust graces the halls of 
the United States Congress, and Hungarians have immi-
grated to the United States since its founding, enriching 
the national fabric of the United States; 
Whereas, in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the 
United States and Hungary committed ‘‘to build, consoli-
date and strengthen democracy as the only system of 
government of our nations’’; 
Whereas Hungary joined the visa waiver program in 2008, 
enabling Hungarians to visit the United States without 
a visa, further strengthening ties between the two coun-
tries; 
Whereas Hungarians voted in a national referendum in 1997 
to join NATO, and the United States supported Hun-
gary’s accession to NATO, building the common alliance 
between the two countries; 
Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty states that all members 
of NATO ‘‘are determined to safeguard the freedom, 
common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, found-
ed on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and 
the rule of law’’; 
Whereas NATO member states have collectively identified 
corruption and poor governance, including within member 
states, as ‘‘security challenges which undermine democ-
racy, the rule of law and economic development’’, dem-
onstrating a shared understanding of the link between 
democratic values and international security;

Whereas democracies with transparent governments, the rule 
of law, free media, and engaged citizens are more natu-
rally resistant to malign influence by the Russian Federa-
tion; 
Whereas the Government of Hungary has rehabilitated fas-
cist-era ideologies, facilitated or amplified anti-Semitic 
messages, and trivialized the Holocaust; 
Whereas according to the Department of State’s Country Re-
port on Human Rights Practices, Hungary has passed a 
series of laws modifying the judicial system, restricting 
the Constitutional Court, altering the rules for electing 
Constitutional Court justices, and vesting the President 
of the National Office for the Judiciary, a position ap-
pointed by the Parliament, with significant decision-
making power; 
Whereas the Organization on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe’s (OSCE) Election Observation Missions to Hun-
gary’s 2014 and 2018 elections concluded that the gov-
erning party enjoyed an undue advantage because of re-
strictive campaign regulations, biased media coverage and 
campaign activities that blurred the separation between 
political party and the state; 
Whereas, in 2014, at least six Hungarian officials were deter-
mined to be ineligible for visas to visit the United States 
because of suspected corruption, while fraud and corrup-
tion has enabled at least 85 criminals to obtain Hun-
garian passports and enter or attempt to enter the 
United States, and Hungary has given refuge to some in-
dividuals convicted of corruption in other countries; 
Whereas, in 2017, Hungary adopted a law on nongovern-
mental organizations that, according to the Department

of State, ‘‘unfairly burdens a targeted group of Hun-
garian civil society organizations, many of which focus on 
fighting corruption and protecting human rights and civil 
liberties’’; 
Whereas, in 2018, more than 400 media publications, 
websites, television channels, and radio stations in Hun-
gary, already concentrated in the hands of a few owners, 
were donated, without compensation, by their owners to 
a central holding company which, according to a subse-
quently passed law, is exempt from competition oversight; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Department of State expressed dis-
appointment that the Government of Hungary did not 
conclude an agreement that would allow Central Euro-
pean University (CEU) to continue its United States-ac-
credited programs and stated that the United States val-
ues the role that CEU and other American educational 
institutions play in building connections between the 
Hungarian and American people and strengthening the 
transatlantic bond; 
Whereas, in 2018, Hungary adopted a law to establish new 
administrative courts with jurisdiction over elections and 
corruption overseen by a politically appointed minister; 
and 
Whereas the Government of Hungary has announced a deci-
sion to grant diplomatic immunity to representatives of 
the International Investment Bank, a bank with ties to 
Russian intelligence services, and allow the bank to open 
a headquarters in Hungary: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

of Hungary has taken steps to weaken democratic

(2) expresses deep concern that the decision by
