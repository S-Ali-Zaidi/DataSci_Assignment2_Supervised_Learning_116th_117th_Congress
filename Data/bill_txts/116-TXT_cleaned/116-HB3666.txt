Congress finds that— 
8
(1) the patent property rights enshrined in the 
9
Constitution of the United States provide the foun-
10
dation for the exceptional innovation environment in 
11
the United States; 
12
(2) strong patent rights encourage United 
13
States inventors to invest their resources in creating 
14
new inventions;

(3) patent protection has led to patient cures, 
1
positive changes to the standard of living for all peo-
2
ple in the United States, and improvements to the 
3
agricultural, telecommunications, and electronics in-
4
dustries, among others; 
5
(4) the United States patent system is an es-
6
sential part of the country’s economic success; 
7
(5) strong patent protection improves the 
8
chances of success for small companies and increases 
9
their chances of securing financing from investors; 
10
(6) intellectual property-intensive industries in 
11
the United States generate tens of millions of jobs 
12
for individuals in the United States; 
13
(7) intellectual property-intensive industries in 
14
the United States account for more than one-third 
15
of the country’s gross domestic product; 
16
(8) in the highly competitive global economy, 
17
the United States needs to uphold strong patent 
18
protections to maintain its position as the world’s 
19
premier innovative country; 
20
(9) Congress last enacted comprehensive re-
21
forms of the patent system in 2011; 
22
(10) unintended consequences of the com-
23
prehensive 2011 reform of patent laws are con-
24

have the effect of harassing patent owners, and the 
4
unnecessary duplication of work by the district 
5
