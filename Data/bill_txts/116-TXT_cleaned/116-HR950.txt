RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of May 5, 2020, 
as the ‘‘National Day of Awareness for Missing and 
Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls’’. 
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.5 times 
more likely to experience violent crimes and at least 2 
times more likely to experience rape or sexual assault 
crimes compared to any other group of people in the 
United States; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
determined that homicide is the third leading cause of 
death among American Indian and Alaska Native women

between 10 and 24 years of age and the fifth leading 
cause of death for American Indian and Alaska Native 
women between 25 and 34 years of age; 
Whereas in some Tribal communities, American Indian 
women face murder rates that are more than 10 times 
the national average; 
Whereas there is little data that exists on the number of 
missing and murdered Native women and girls in the 
United States due to complex jurisdictional issues at the 
Tribal, State, and Federal levels; 
Whereas investigation into cases of missing and murdered 
Native women and girls is made difficult for Tribal law 
enforcement agencies due to a lack of resources and the 
complex jurisdictional scheme that exists in Indian coun-
try; 
Whereas violence as a lived experience of Native women exists 
in less pressing times, and it is expected that the 
COVID–19 pandemic will increase the prevalence of vio-
lence that is experienced by Native women by exacer-
bating already existing issues including: lack of safe 
housing for victims, lack of space in shelters for victims 
to maintain safe social distancing, lack of personal pro-
tective equipment for staff of Tribal shelters and victim 
services programs, limited transportation for victims, and 
lack of access to adequate health care; 
Whereas the Administration for Native Americans reports 
that American Indian, Alaska Native, and Pacific Is-
lander women and girls have a heightened risk for sex 
trafficking, and Native women continue to go missing 
and murdered across the country at disproportionate 
rates, and COVID–19 is likely to exacerbate this national

injustice due to the virus’ impact on already limited jus-
tice, health, and advocacy responses; 
Whereas the current funding available in Indian country is 
inadequate to address the needs of victims, from the pro-
vision of basic, emergency services and responses to more 
comprehensive, long-term services in normal times, and 
even less so during a pandemic such as COVID–19; and 
Whereas without recognition of this crisis and adequate Fed-
eral assistance and improved distribution of lifesaving re-
sources for Indian Tribes, Indigenous women will con-
tinue to experience disproportionate rates of violence, and 
go missing and be murdered at the highest rates in the 
country: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses support for the designation of the

‘‘National Day of Awareness for Missing and Mur-

dered Native Women and Girls’’; and 
4
(2) calls on the people of the United States and 
5
interested groups— 
6
(A) to commemorate the lives of missing 
7
and murdered American Indian and Alaska Na-
8
tive women whose cases are documented and 
9
undocumented in public records and the media; 
10
and 
11
(B) to demonstrate solidarity with the fam-
12
ilies of victims in light of these tragedies.
