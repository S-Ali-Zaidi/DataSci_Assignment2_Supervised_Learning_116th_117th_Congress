SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In 2014, the Department of Labor identi-
3
fied 136 goods from 74 countries around the world 
4
made by forced labor and child labor. 
5
(2) The United States is the world’s largest im-
6
porter, and in the 21st century, investors, con-
7
sumers, and broader civil society increasingly de-
8
mand information about the human rights impact of 
9
products in the United States market. 
10
(3) Courts have ruled that consumers do not 
11
have standing to bring a civil action in United 
12
States courts for enforcement of a provision in the 
13
Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 prohibiting impor-
14
tation of goods made with forced labor or convict 
15
labor, and furthermore, the provision has a broad 
16
exception for goods that cannot be produced in the 
17
United States in sufficient quantities to meet the de-
18
mands of American consumers from tainted goods, 
19
consequently, there are fewer than 40 enforcement 
20
actions on record in the past 80 years. 
21
(4) Mechanisms under Federal law to prevent 
22
and punish perpetrators of forced labor, slavery, 
23
human trafficking, and the worst forms of child 
24
labor in the stream of commerce suffer from prob-
25
lems of limited scope, broad expectations, and lack 
26

•HR 6279 IH
of available information about goods that are pro-
1
duced along supply chains tainted by these crimes 
2
and imported by the United States. 
3
(5) The Trafficking Victims Protection Reau-
4
thorization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108–193) to-
5
gether with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 
6
of 2005 (Public Law 109–164) provide for the ter-
7
mination of Federal contracts where a Federal con-
8
tractor or subcontractor engages in severe forms of 
9
trafficking in persons or has procured a commercial 
10
sex act during the period of time that the grant, 
11
contract, or cooperative agreement is in effect, or 
12
uses forced labor in the performance of the grant, 
13
contract, or cooperative agreement. The Trafficking 
14
Victims Protection Act of 2005 also provides United 
15
States courts with criminal jurisdiction abroad over 
16
Federal employees, contractors, or subcontractors 
17
who participate in severe forms of trafficking in per-
18
sons or forced labor.

2013 (Public Law 112–239) have prohibited Federal 
1
contractors, subcontractors, and their employees 
2
from engaging in the following trafficking-related ac-
3
tivities: charging labor recruitment fees; confiscating 
4
passports and other identity documents of workers; 
5
and using fraudulent recruitment practices, includ-
6
ing failing to disclose basic information or making 
7
material misrepresentations about the terms and 
8
conditions of employment. Such Executive order and 
9
Acts also require Federal contractors, subcontrac-
10
tors, and their employees to maintain an anti-traf-
11
ficking compliance plan that includes, among other 
12
elements, a complaint mechanism and procedures to 
13
prevent subcontractors at any tier in the supply 
14
chain from engaging in trafficking in persons. 
15
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
16
gress that— 
17
(1) forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, 
18
and the worst forms of child labor are among the 
19
most egregious forms of abuse that humans commit 
20
against each other, for the sake of commercial prof-
21
it; 
22
(2) the legislative and regulatory framework to 
23
prevent goods produced by forced labor, slavery, 
24
human trafficking, and the worst forms of child

•HR 6279 IH
labor from passing into the stream of commerce in 
1
the United States is gravely inadequate; 
2
(3) legislation is necessary to provide consumers 
3
information on products that are free of child labor, 
4
forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking; and 
5
(4) through publicly available disclosures, busi-
6
nesses and consumers can avoid inadvertently pro-
7
moting or sanctioning these crimes through produc-
8
tion and purchase of raw materials, goods and fin-
9
ished products that have been tainted in the supply 
10
chains.
