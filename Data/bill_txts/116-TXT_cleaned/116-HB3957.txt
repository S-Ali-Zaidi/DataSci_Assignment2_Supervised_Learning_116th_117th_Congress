To direct the Federal Communications Commission to take

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expanding Broadcast 
4
Ownership Opportunities Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 3957 IH
(1) One of the main missions of the Federal 
1
Communications Commission, and a compelling gov-
2
ernmental interest, is to ensure that there is a diver-
3
sity of ownership and viewpoints in the broadcasting 
4
industry. 
5
(2) The Commission should continue to collect 
6
relevant data and conduct studies on such diversity 
7
and make appropriate recommendations to Congress 
8
on how to increase the number of minority- and 
9
women-owned broadcast stations. 
10
(3) Data from 2014 shows that, of the over 
11
1,700 commercial broadcast television stations in the 
12
United States, less than 6 percent are owned by 
13
women, and less than 3 percent are minority-owned. 
14
With respect to radio stations, women owned ap-
15
proximately 7 percent of FM broadcast radio sta-
16
tions, and minorities owned less than 3 percent of 
17
such stations. 
18
(4) Women and minority ownership is 5 to 10 
19
times higher in other industries than in the broad-
20
casting industry. 
21
(5) During the 17 years that a minority tax 
22
certificate program was in place at the Commission 
23
(from 1978 to 1995), the Commission issued 287 
24
02:43 Aug 13, 2019

•HR 3957 IH
certificates for radio stations and 40 certificates for 
1
television stations. 
2
(6) The Commission can also support minority- 
3
and women-owned entrants into the broadcasting in-
4
dustry by implementing an incubator program in 
5
which existing licensees assist new entrants in the 
6
operation of broadcast stations.
