cial institutions, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Taiwan Non-Discrimi-
4
nation Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) As enshrined in its Articles of Agreement, 
8
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is devoted 
9
to promoting international monetary cooperation, fa-

cilitating the expansion and balanced growth of 
1
international trade, encouraging exchange stability, 
2
and avoiding competitive exchange depreciation. 
3
(2) Taiwan is the 22nd largest economy in the 
4
world and the 10th largest goods trading partner of 
5
the United States. 
6
(3) Although Taiwan is not an IMF member, it 
7
is a member of the World Trade Organization, the 
8
Asian Development Bank, and the Asia-Pacific Eco-
9
nomic Cooperation forum. 
10
(4) According to the January 2020 Report on 
11
Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of 
12
Major Trading Partners of the United States, pub-
13
lished by the Department of the Treasury, Taiwan 
14
held $471,900,000,000 in foreign exchange reserves, 
15
more than major economies such as India, South 
16
Korea, and Brazil. 
17
(5) According to section 4(d) of the Taiwan Re-
18
lations Act (Public Law 96–8), enacted on April 10, 
19
1979, ‘‘Nothing in this Act may be construed as a 
20
basis for supporting the exclusion or expulsion of 
21
Taiwan from continued membership in any inter-
22
national financial institution or any other inter-
23
national organization.’’.

(6) Taiwan held membership in the IMF for 9 
1
years following the recognition of the People’s Re-
2
public of China (PRC) by the United Nations, and 
3
16 Taiwan staff members at the Fund were allowed 
4
to continue their employment after the PRC was 
5
seated at the IMF in 1980. As James M. Boughton 
6
has noted in his Silent Revolution: The International 
7
Monetary Fund 1979–1989, even as the PRC was 
8
seated, the United States Executive Director to the 
9
IMF, Sam Y. Cross, expressed support on behalf of 
10
the United States government for ‘‘some kind of as-
11
sociation between Taiwan and the Fund’’. 
12
(7) On September 27, 1994, in testimony be-
13
fore the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations re-
14
garding the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, then-As-
15
sistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific 
16
Affairs Winston Lord stated: ‘‘Recognizing Taiwan’s 
17
important role in transnational issues, we will sup-
18
port its membership in organizations where state-
19
hood is not a prerequisite, and we will support op-
20
portunities for Taiwan’s voice to be heard in organi-
21
zations where its membership is not possible.’’. 
22
(8) The Congress has repeatedly reaffirmed 
23
support for this policy, including in Public Laws 
24
107–10, 107–158, 108–28, 108–235, 113–17, and

114–139, and the unanimous House and Senate 
1
passage of the Taiwan Allies International Protec-
2
tion and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 
3
2019. 
4
(9) In its fact sheet, entitled ‘‘U.S. Relations 
5
with Taiwan’’, published on August 31, 2018, the 
6
Department of State asserts: ‘‘The United States 
7
supports Taiwan’s membership in international orga-
8
nizations that do not require statehood as a condi-
9
tion of membership and encourages Taiwan’s mean-
10
ingful participation in international organizations 
11
where its membership is not possible.’’. 
12
(10) According to the Articles of Agreement of 
13
the IMF, ‘‘membership shall be open to other coun-
14
tries’’, subject to conditions prescribed by the Board 
15
of Governors of the IMF. 
16
(11) In the IMF publication ‘‘Membership and 
17
Nonmembership in the International Monetary 
18
Fund: A Study in International Law and Organiza-
19
tion’’, Joseph Gold, the then-General Counsel and 
20
Director of the Legal Department of the IMF, elabo-
21
rated on the differences between the terms ‘‘coun-
22
tries’’ and ‘‘states’’, noting that ‘‘the word ‘country’ 
23
may have been adopted because of the absence of 
24
agreement on the definition of a ‘state’ ’’ and, with 
25
04:11 Jun 14, 2020
H6974
5 
•HR 6974 IH
respect to the use of ‘‘countries’’ and applications 
1
for IMF membership, ‘‘the absence of any adjective 
2
in the Articles emphasizes the breadth of the discre-
3
tion that the Fund may exercise in admitting coun-
4
tries to membership’’. According to Mr. Gold, ‘‘the 
5
desire to give the Fund flexibility in dealing with ap-
6
plications may explain not only the absence of any 
7
adjective that qualifies ‘countries’ but also the choice 
8
of that word itself’’. 
9
(12) In his IMF study, Mr. Gold further ob-
10
serves, ‘‘in the practice of the Fund the concepts of 
11
independence and sovereignty have been avoided on 
12
the whole as a mode of expressing a criterion for 
13
membership in the Fund’’. He continues, ‘‘Although 
14
the Fund usually takes into account the recognition 
15
or nonrecognition of an entity as a state, there are 
16
no rules or even informal understandings on the ex-
17
tent to which an applicant must have been recog-
18
nized by members or other international organiza-
19
tions before the Fund will regard it as eligible for 
20
membership.’’. In fact, when considering an applica-
21
tion for membership where the status of an appli-
22
cant may not be resolved, Mr. Gold writes ‘‘there 
23
have been occasions on which the Fund has made a 
24
finding before decisions had been taken by the 
25

•HR 6974 IH
United Nations or by most members or by members 
1
with a majority of the total voting power.’’ Mr. Gold 
2
concludes, ‘‘the Fund makes its own findings on 
3
whether an applicant is a ‘country’, and makes them 
4
solely for its own purposes.’’. 
5
(13) Although not a member state of the 
6
United Nations, the Republic of Kosovo is a member 
7
of both the IMF and the World Bank, having joined 
8
both organizations on June 29, 2009.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. 
10
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
11
(1) the size, significance, and connectedness of 
12
the Taiwan economy highlight the importance of 
13
greater participation by Taiwan in the International 
14
Monetary Fund, given the purposes of the Fund ar-
15
ticulated in its Articles of Agreement; and 
16
(2) the experience of Taiwan in developing a vi-
17
brant and advanced economy under democratic gov-
18
ernance and the rule of law should inform the work 
19
of the international financial institutions, including 
20
through increased participation by Taiwan in the in-
21
stitutions.
