RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of May 30 as ‘‘National 
Bartter Syndrome Day’’. 
Whereas Bartter syndrome is a rare kidney condition that 
causes an imbalance of potassium, sodium, chloride, and 
other molecules in the body; 
Whereas the antenatal form of Bartter syndrome, which be-
gins before birth, is often life-threatening and is charac-
terized by abnormally high levels of amniotic fluid sur-
rounding the affected fetus, premature delivery, and salt 
loss; 
Whereas the classical form of Bartter syndrome, which begins 
in early childhood and tends to be less severe, causes in-
dividuals to experience fatigue, muscle weakness, growth 
delay, and developmental delay;

•HRES 181 IH 
Whereas Bartter syndrome likely affects approximately one 
per million people worldwide, although the exact preva-
lence is unknown; 
Whereas increased awareness and research of Bartter syn-
drome will promote accurate and early recognition of the 
disorder and help families with children suffering from 
this condition cope with the associated difficulties; and 
Whereas May 30 would be an appropriate date to designate 
as ‘‘National Bartter Syndrome Day’’: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports
