RESOLUTION 
Expressing the need for immediate climate action in response 
to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change Special Report on the Ocean and 
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. 
Whereas every person on the planet benefits from a healthy 
ocean and a stable cryosphere;

Whereas the ocean covers more than 70 percent of the 
Earth’s surface; 
Whereas the cryosphere includes the frozen components of 
the Earth’s system, including snow, glaciers, ice sheets, 
ice shelves, icebergs, sea ice, and permafrost; 
Whereas glaciers, ice sheets, and permanent snow hold ap-
proximately 69 percent of Earth’s freshwater; 
Whereas the ocean generates the oxygen that we breathe, reg-
ulates our climate and weather patterns, supplies food, is 
a source of cultural value, supports tourism and trade, 
and is an untapped renewable energy resource; 
Whereas the ocean and cryosphere support biodiversity and 
regulate the global exchange of water, energy, and car-
bon; 
Whereas, on September 25, 2019, the United Nations Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released 
the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a 
Changing Climate (SROCC); 
Whereas the SROCC is the most comprehensive scientific as-
sessment of the effects of climate change on our ocean 
and coasts, and polar and mountain ecosystems to date; 
Whereas more than 100 scientists from 36 countries pro-
duced the SROCC and it was reviewed by thousands of 
scientific experts from around the world; 
Whereas according to the SROCC— 
(1) the ocean has taken up more than 90 percent of 
excess heat in the climate system since 1970 and has 
warmed as a direct result of anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions;

(2) marine heatwaves have very likely doubled in fre-
quency from 1982 to 2016 and are very likely to become 
longer-lasting, more intense, and more extensive; 
(3) the rate of ocean warming has more than dou-
bled since 1993; 
(4) the ocean has very likely absorbed up to 30 per-
cent of total anthropogenic carbon since the 1980s, caus-
ing the ocean to become more acidic; 
(5) the ocean is losing oxygen at an unprecedented 
rate, and oxygen loss will very likely emerge over 59 to 
80 percent of the ocean surface by 2031–2050; 
(6) harmful algal blooms have expanded and in-
creased in frequency in coastal environments since the 
1980s as a result of ocean warming, acidification, and ox-
ygen loss; 
(7) in some regions, fish and shellfish stocks are al-
ready on the brink of collapsing; 
(8) environmental stressors like ocean acidification, 
oxygen loss, and warming ocean temperatures are ex-
pected to further compromise the abundance, produc-
tivity, and food-web interactions of species; 
(9) the decrease in biodiversity, and decline and 
shifts in distribution of fisheries will affect the livelihoods 
and food-security of coastal communities; 
(10) warmer ocean temperatures are fueling extreme 
weather events; 
(11) currently rare extreme sea level events are ex-
pected to occur frequently by 2050; 
(12) in the absence of significant adaptation efforts, 
extreme events associated with sea level rise, like erosion, 
flooding, and salinization, are expected to significantly in-
crease;

(13) nearly 50 percent of coastal wetlands have been 
lost over the 20th century, and 20 to 90 percent of coast-
al wetlands are projected to be lost by 2100 as a result 
of sea level rise and habitat degradation; 
(14) coastal blue carbon ecosystems can contribute 
to climate mitigation by storing carbon; 
(15) river runoff in snow-dominated and glacier-fed 
basins are projected to change in response to projected 
snow cover and glacier decline; 
(16) glacial and snow meltwater reductions have re-
sulted in reduced water supply, declined agriculture pro-
ductivity, and increased wildfires in mountain regions 
and the Arctic; 
(17) tourism and outdoor recreation activities have 
been negatively affected by the cryosphere decline; 
(18) Arctic sea ice is declining in all months of the 
year and sea-ice free summers are increasingly likely 
under 2°C of global warming; 
(19) Arctic surface air temperatures have likely in-
creased by more than double the global average in the 
last two decades, resulting in more sea ice and snow 
cover loss; and 
(20) widespread thaw and degradation of permafrost 
is projected to occur this century and is anticipated to re-
lease tens to hundreds of billions of tons of carbon diox-
ide and methane into the atmosphere; 
Whereas the United States is already facing the consequences 
of inaction on climate change; 
Whereas communities of color, Indigenous communities, and 
low-income communities often face the disproportionate 
effects of inaction on climate change;

Whereas reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to 
a clean energy economy, and investing in climate adapta-
tion efforts can support good-paying jobs; 
Whereas, in 2018, the IPCC released a special report titled 
‘‘Global Warming of 1.5°C’’ which found that to limit 
global warming to 1.5°C, net global greenhouse gas emis-
sions must be reduced to 45 percent below 2010 levels by 
2030 and 100 percent below 2010 levels by 2050; 
Whereas the United States has a responsibility to enact poli-
cies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent 
below 2010 levels no later than 2030 and achieve net 
zero emissions no later than 2050; and 
Whereas as Congress enacts policies to put the country on a 
path to net zero emissions, there is an opportunity for 
the ocean to be part of the climate solution: Now, there-
fore, be it
