A BILL 
To establish a cost of greenhouse gases for carbon dioxide, 
methane, and nitrous oxide to be used by Federal agen-
cies, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Carbon Pollution 
4
Transparency Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—

•HR 8174 IH
(1) sound economic and policy analyses require 
1
that the economic benefits of reducing climate 
2
change be considered together with the costs of poli-
3
cies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
4
sions; 
5
(2) climate change, if not addressed, is pro-
6
jected to inflict substantial damage on the economy 
7
and people of the United States; 
8
(3) according to the Congressional Budget Of-
9
fice, the Government Accountability Office, and the 
10
Office of Management and Budget, the impacts of 
11
climate change are— 
12
(A) costing United States taxpayers bil-
13
lions of dollars annually; and 
14
(B) putting pressure on the Federal budg-
15
et; 
16
(4) the expenditures by the Federal Govern-
17
ment resulting from the effects of climate change 
18
are projected to increase, and reducing greenhouse 
19
gas emissions presents an opportunity to minimize 
20
those expenditures; 
21
(5) between calendar years 2008 and 2015, the 
22
United States reduced carbon pollution from the en-
23
ergy sector by nearly 10 percent, while the economy 
24
grew more than 10 percent; 
25
05:32 Sep 07, 2020
H8174

•HR 8174 IH
(6) more than 1,200 companies are taking the 
1
cost of climate change into consideration in business 
2
decisions; 
3
(7) estimates of the costs of greenhouse gases 
4
provide a method and measure, grounded in sci-
5
entific and economic research, for monetizing— 
6
(A) the costs of greenhouse gas emissions; 
7
and 
8
(B) the benefits of reducing greenhouse 
9
gas emissions; 
10
(8) the National Academies of Sciences, Engi-
11
neering, and Medicine has provided detailed rec-
12
ommendations for improving the estimate of the 
13
costs of greenhouse gases for the purpose of regu-
14
latory analysis; 
15
(9) the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
16
by other countries benefits the United States by re-
17
ducing climate risks to the United States, and the 
18
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the United 
19
States benefits other countries; 
20
(10) in light of the global nature of the problem 
21
of greenhouse gas emissions, the interests of the 
22
United States would be maximized if the United 
23
States were to use a calculation method of the cost 
24
of climate pollution that reflects global damages; 
25
05:32 Sep 07, 2020

•HR 8174 IH
(11) due to the nature of climate change risks, 
1
the returns on mitigation may pay off in periods 
2
that would otherwise involve substantial losses; 
3
(12) economic theory and evidence suggests 
4
that, for actions with intergenerational consequences 
5
such as the consequences of climate change, a dis-
6
count rate approximately equal to or less than the 
7
long-term yield on the debt of the Treasury of the 
8
United States may be appropriate; and 
9
(13) it is imperative that the academic commu-
10
nity continue research on the cost of greenhouse 
11
gases.

for the cost of carbon dioxide, cost of methane, and

(2) CONSIDERATIONS.—In carrying out a revi-
7
sion evaluation under paragraph (1) or a revision 
8
under subsection (b), the Working Group shall—

(B) assess any proposed revision of the cal-
5
culation method with respect to— 
6
(i) consistency with the state of sci-
7
entific knowledge, as reflected by current,

(ii) the adequacy with which the pro-
10
posed calculation method identifies and

the date on which the applicable revision eval-
16

future that would allow estimation of the vast 
18
majority of discounted climate damages; 
19
(D) apply 1 or more discount rates, which 
20
shall— 
21
(i) account for the intergenerational 
22
nature of the harm caused by climate 
23
change; and
