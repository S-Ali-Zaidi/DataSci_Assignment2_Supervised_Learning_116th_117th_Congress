(1) 200,000 riders travel through the 111 year 
1
old, two-track North River Tunnel under the Hud-
2
son River daily. 
3
(2) The North River Tunnel serves a region 
4
that is home to 17 percent of the United States pop-
5
ulation which contributes 20 percent to the national 
6
Gross Domestic Product. 
7
(3) The Northeast Corridor, which is operated 
8
by Amtrak and runs between Boston, Massachusetts 
9
and Washington, DC, has the highest ridership of 
10
any intercity rail line in the United States and runs 
11
directly through the North River Tunnel. 
12
(4) Superstorm Sandy caused $65 billion worth 
13
of damages and 147 direct deaths in 2012, exacer-
14
bating the need to perform extensive repairs to both 
15
tracks. A new tunnel must be built to keep regular 
16
train service running while the damage is fixed. 
17
(5) According to the Regional Plan Association, 
18
if one of the tracks loses functionality and needs to 
19
be shut down, the national economy could lose $16 
20
billion over a 4-year span, equivalent to the loss of 
21
33,000 jobs. 
22
(6) A tunnel shutdown would significantly de-
23
crease transportation options in the region, increas-

ing commute times in many cases by more than an 
1
hour a day. 
2
(7) A tunnel shutdown could also cause $22 bil-
3
lion in decreased property values, $7 billion in lost 
4
tax revenue for Federal, State, and local govern-
5
ments, and 38,000 additional car crashes. 
6
(8) Currently, only 24 trains can use the tunnel 
7
every hour. That number would drop to 6 in the 
8
event of a shutdown. 
9
(9) The Gateway Program, which incorporates 
10
the Hudson Tunnel Project, would double the num-
11
ber of trains per hour by building a new, flood-proof 
12
tunnel. 
13
(10) The Federal Transit Administration rated 
14
the Hudson Tunnel Project ‘‘Medium-Low’’ in re-
15
sponse to the project’s s5309 Capital Investment 
16
Grant submission. 
17
