SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The National People’s Congress (referred to 
6
in this Act as ‘‘NPC’’) of the PRC has committed 
7
to pass national security legislation which, if en-
8
acted, would— 
9
(A) contravene the will of the people of 
10
Hong Kong whose constitution, the Basic Law, 
11
provides in Article 23 that the Legislative 
12
Council of Hong Kong shall enact legislation re-
13
lated to national security; 
14
(B) violate the PRC’s commitments under 
15
international law, as defined by the Joint Dec-
16
laration of the Government of the United King-
17
dom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and 
18
the Government of the PRC on the Question of 
19
Hong Kong (referred to in this Act as ‘‘Joint 
20
Declaration’’), an international treaty signed on 
21
December 19, 1984, and entered into force on 
22
May 27, 1985; and 
23
(C) cause severe and irreparable damage to

further erode global confidence in the PRC’s 
1
commitment to international law. 
2
(2) The United States has a long and proud 
3
history as a destination for refugees and asylees flee-
4
ing persecution based on race, religion, nationality, 
5
political opinion, or membership in a particular so-
6
cial group. 
7
(3) The United States also shares deep social, 
8
cultural, and economic ties with the people of Hong 
9
Kong, including a shared commitment to democracy, 
10
to the rule of law, and to the protection of human 
11
rights. 
12
(4) The United States has sheltered, protected, 
13
and welcomed as American citizens individuals who 
14
have fled oppression of authoritarian regimes, in-
15
cluding citizens from the PRC following the violent 
16
June 4, 1989, crackdown in Tiananmen Square, 
17
deepening ties between the people of the United 
18
States and those individuals, regardless of nation-
19
ality, seeking to contribute to a free, open society 
20
founded on respect for the rule of law. 
21
(5) The United States has reaped enormous 
22
economic, cultural, and strategic benefit from wel-
23
coming successive generations of scientists, doctors, 
24
entrepreneurs, artists, intellectuals, and other free-

1
lent Islamist extremism, and other repressive 
2
ideologies, including in the case of Nazi Germany, 
3
the Soviet Union and Soviet-controlled Central Eu-
4
rope, Cuba, Vietnam, and Iran. 
5
(6) Offering prospective refuge to those who 
6
have contributed the most to Hong Kong’s success 
7
would signal to the Chinese Communist Party that 
8
repression in Hong Kong would result in losing its 
9
immense wealth and talent to the United States. 
10
(7) A mid-2020 Brookings report notes that 
11
‘‘Chinese officials see the United States’ continued 
12
ability to attract and retain Chinese talent as a seri-
13
ous impediment to their technological ambitions’’ 
14
and a 2009 report of ‘‘Issues in Science and Tech-
15
nology’’ notes that ‘‘competition for [science and 
16
technology] brainpower . . . will become one of the 
17
key defining features of the West’s interactions with 
18
the PRC over the coming decades.’’ 
19
(8) A major asymmetric advantage of the 
20
United States in its long-term strategic competition 
21
with the Communist Party of China is the ability of 
22
people from every country in the world, irrespective 
23
of their race, ethnicity or religion, to immigrate to 
24
the United States and become American citizens.

Hong Kong are of great importance to the 
15
United States and are directly relevant to 
16
United States interests in Hong Kong and 
17
serve as a basis for Hong Kong’s continued eco-
18
nomic prosperity’’; and 
19
(D) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently 
20

that accorded the People’s Republic of China’’;
