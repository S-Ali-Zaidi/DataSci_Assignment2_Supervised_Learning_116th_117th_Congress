RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives on 
the continued importance of the United States-Lebanon 
relationship. 
Whereas the security, sovereignty, independence, and terri-
torial integrity of Lebanon, a pluralistic democracy in the 
Middle East, is in the interest of the United States and 
its allies in the region; 
Whereas, for more than a decade, the United States has pro-
vided robust assistance to Lebanon, including training 
and equipment for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), 
development assistance through the Economic Support 
Fund (ESF), funding for schools and hospitals in Leb-
anon through the American Schools and Hospitals

Abroad (ASHA) Program, and funding for the U.S.-Mid-
dle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI); 
Whereas the integrity and independence of the LAF serves 
a United States national security interest; 
Whereas the LAF has been a critical stabilizing force in Leb-
anon with a longstanding partnership with the United 
States military; 
Whereas the United States has provided over $1,000,000,000 
in foreign military and security assistance to the LAF; 
Whereas the LAF, as the primary institution entrusted with 
Lebanon’s defense, security, and sovereignty, is an impor-
tant force to support the safety and security of Lebanon; 
Whereas international support for the United Nations In-
terim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) remains necessary to 
counteract destabilizing forces in Lebanon and help lower 
tensions at the Lebanon-Israel border; 
Whereas UNIFIL has been effective in facilitating tripartite 
dialogues between the Lebanese and Israeli military offi-
cials and in conducting numerous border patrols in part-
nership with the LAF, to deescalate the possibilities of 
‘‘unintended consequences leading to violent conflict’’; 
Whereas United States support for American institutions in 
Lebanon through programs such as ASHA, MEPI, and 
ESF assistance are vital for fostering democratic ideals 
and principles throughout Lebanon; 
Whereas Lebanon hosts an estimated 1,500,000 refugees, a 
population equal to almost one-third of its native popu-
lation and the highest refugee-per-capita ratio in the 
world, despite challenges within its own social and eco-
nomic sectors;

Whereas Hezbollah alongside corrupt elites have taken advan-
tage of the Lebanese economy, government, and its citi-
zens; 
Whereas Iran seeks to eliminate Lebanon’s sovereignty and 
its history as a strong United States ally and democratic 
actor in the Middle East; 
Whereas Hezbollah continues to harm the Lebanese people by 
violating United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1701 (2006), perpetuating undue foreign influence from 
Iran, harming the distinct demographic and social equi-
librium of Lebanon, stoking sectarian violence, weakening 
the Lebanese economy, and supporting corruption and vi-
olence within Lebanon; 
Whereas corruption in the Lebanese public sector remains 
unchecked, despite calls for efforts to combat corruption 
in all government and social society sectors; 
Whereas the harmful politicization of the independent judici-
ary in Lebanon is untenable and is being met with strong 
disagreement by the Lebanese people and international 
actors; and 
Whereas respect for the rule of law and democratic principles 
of an independent and free press, long supported in Leb-
anon, must persist at the highest levels: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) notes that the United States provides assist-
2
ance to the people of Lebanon in order to support

services and security for Lebanese citizens, particu-

larly to counter the growing influence and negative

impact of Hezbollah and other destabilizing actors;
