1
following: 
2
‘‘(iv)(I) In the case of a petition to add a spe-
3
cies to a list of threatened species, the petitioned ac-
4
tion may be warranted but is precluded due to the 
5
likelihood of significant, cumulative economic effects

that would result from listing or, to the extent it can 
7
be determined, from the likely resulting designation 
8
of critical habitat of the species.

‘‘(II) The Secretary may not reconsider such 
10
finding unless— 
11
‘‘(aa) the Secretary determines there is 
12

‘‘(bb) the Secretary receives a new petition 
14
to add such species to such list that includes a 
15
written qualitative and quantitative analyses re-
16
examining the incremental and significant, cu-
17
mulative economic effects of likely actions to 
18
protect the petitioned species and its potential 
19
habitat upon each State and locality that is af-
20
fected by the petitioned species listing and that, 
21
in the opinion of the Secretary, credibly con-
22
cludes that alternative actions are possible 
23
other than those resulting in significant, cumu-
24
lative economic effects.
