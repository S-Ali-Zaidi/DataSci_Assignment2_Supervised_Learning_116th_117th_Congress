(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 194 IH
(1) Iran is a member of the United Nations, 
1
voted for the Universal Declaration of Human 
2
Rights, and is a signatory to the International Cov-
3
enant on Civil and Political Rights, among other 
4
international human rights treaties. 
5
(2) In violation of these and other international 
6
obligations, Iranian regime officials continue to vio-
7
late the fundamental human rights of the Iranian 
8
people. 
9
(3) The Iranian regime persecutes ethnic and 
10
religious minority groups, such as the Baha’is, 
11
Christians, Sufi, Sunni, and dissenting Shi’a Mus-
12
lims 
(such 
as 
imprisoned 
Ayatollah 
Hossein 
13
Kazemeyni Boroujerdi), through harassment, ar-
14
rests, and imprisonment, during which detainees 
15
have routinely been beaten, tortured, and killed. 
16
(4) Following voting irregularities that resulted 
17
in the 2009 election of President Mahmoud 
18
Ahmadinejad, the Iranian regime brutally sup-
19
pressed peaceful political dissent from wide segments 
20
of civil society during the Green Revolution in a cyn-
21
ical attempt to retain its undemocratic grip on 
22
power. 
23
(5) Since February 2011, the leaders of Iran’s 
24
Green Movement, former Prime Minister Mir

Hossein Mousavi and his wife Dr. Zahra Rahnavard, 
1
have been incarcerated, and former Speaker of the 
2
Majles (parliament) Mehdi Karroubi has lived under 
3
strict house arrest, ordered by Iran’s Supreme Na-
4
tional Security. 
5
(6) In 1999 the Iranian regime brutally sup-
6
pressed a student revolt that was one of the largest 
7
mass uprisings up until that point in the country 
8
since 1979. 
9
(7) Over a 4-month period in 1988, the Iranian 
10
regime carried out the barbaric mass executions of 
11
thousands of political prisoners by hanging and fir-
12
ing squad for refusing to renounce their political af-
13
filiations and in some cases for possessing political 
14
reading material, including prisoners of conscience, 
15
teenagers, and pregnant women. In an audiotape, 
16
the late Hussein Ali Montazeri, a grand ayatollah 
17
who served as former Supreme leader Khomeini’s 
18
chief deputy, said that the 1988 mass killings were 
19
‘‘the greatest crime committed during the Islamic 
20
Republic, for which history will condemn us’’. 
21
(8) Senior governmental, military, and public 
22
security officials in Iran have continued ordering, 
23
controlling, and committing egregious human rights

violations that, in many cases, represent official poli-
1
cies of the Iranian regime. 
2
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the 
3
Congress that the United States should— 
4
(1) deny the Government of Iran the ability to 
5
continue to oppress the people of Iran and to use vi-
6
olence and executions to silence pro-democracy 
7
protestors; 
8
(2) work with international partners to inves-
9
tigate human rights violations by senior officials of 
10
the Government of Iran, regardless of where or when 
11
such violations took place; 
12
(3) support efforts made by the people of Iran 
13
to promote the establishment of basic freedoms that 
14
build the foundation for the emergence of a freely 
15
elected, open, non-corrupt and democratic political 
16
system; 
17
(4) condemn Iranian human rights abuses 
18
against dissidents, including the massacre in 1988 
19
and the suppression of political demonstrations in 
20
1999, 2009, and 2017, and pressure the Govern-
21
ment of Iran to provide family members detailed in-
22
formation that they were denied about the final rest-
23
ing places of any missing victims of such abuses;

8
ment of Iran and other individuals responsible for serious

SEC. 4. UNITED STATES POLICY ON HOSTAGE-TAKING BY 
12
THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN. 
13
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
14
(1) Since 1979 the Iranian regime has engaged 
15
in various destabilizing activities that undermine the 
16
national security of the United States and its allies 
17
and partners. 
18
(2) These activities include the hostage-taking 
19
or prolonged arbitrary detentions of United States 
20
citizens and other persons with connections to Can-
21
ada, the United Kingdom, France, and other nations 
22
allied with the United States.

(3) The Iranian regime has detained on fab-
24
ricated claims a significant number of United States

1
Xiyue Wang, as well as United States legal perma-
2
nent resident, Nizar Zakka, in violation of inter-
3
national legal norms.

(4) The Iranian regime has not provided infor-
5
mation on the whereabouts of or assistance in ensur-

ing the prompt and safe return of Robert Levinson, 
7
despite repeated promises to do so, after he was kid-
8
napped while visiting Iran’s Kish Island on March 9, 
9
2007—making him the longest held hostage in 
10
United States history. 
11
(5) The Iranian regime reportedly uses hostages 
12
as leverage against foreign investors to exact busi-
13
ness concessions in foreign investment deals. 
14
(6) The type of hostage-taking enterprise put in 
15
place by the Iranian regime is a crime against hu-
16
manity and a violation of customary international 
17
law. 
18

16
ture.
