(1) The current Ebola outbreak in the Demo-

tory and has a reported 1,778 confirmed total cases, 
1
and 1,153 confirmed deaths. 
2
(2) Despite the use of preventive tools and new 
3
therapeutics, insecurity and community resistance to 
4
response efforts remain major obstacles to ending 
5
the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Re-
6
public of the Congo, and the outbreak continues to 
7
spread. 
8
(3) Hospitals, health clinics, and Ebola clinics 
9
have been repeatedly attacked by armed actors. 
10
(4) On February 28, 2019, Doctors Without 
11
Borders suspended its work in Ebola epicenters after 
12
two treatment centers were attacked. 
13
(5) On April 19, 2019, Dr. Richard Valery 
14
Mouzoko Kiboung, an epidemiologist from Cameroon 
15
deployed by the World Health Organization to east-
16
ern Congo to help stop the outbreak, was killed in 
17
an attack on Butembo University Hospital. 
18
(6) Healthcare workers responding to Ebola 
19
have expressed concerns about their ability to con-
20
tinue working on the response given the complex se-
21
curity situation. 
22
(7) If the outbreak is not brought under con-
23
trol, it risks spreading across the border to neigh-
24
boring countries and endangering millions of people.
