SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Transit Worker and 
2
Pedestrian Protection Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Public transportation workers are vital to 
6
the safe, efficient, and affordable movement of peo-
7
ple and to the economic prosperity of the country. 
8
(2) Assaults on public transportation workers 
9
are a growing problem, with daily reports of bus op-
10
erators and rail transit employees being beaten, hav-
11
ing items thrown at them, being spat upon, and 
12
being verbally abused. 
13
(3) This is not only a tragic situation for public 
14
transportation workers, but also a major safety risk 
15
for passengers, other motorists, and pedestrians. 
16
(4) An additional risk to safe bus operation is 
17
the existence of blind spots in the view from a bus 
18
operator workstation that— 
19
(A) prevent a driver from fully seeing the 
20
driver’s surroundings; and 
21
(B) have caused serious accidents with pe-
22
destrians. 
23
(5) Blind spots are avoidable, and buses can be 
24
designed to provide the bus operator a clear view 
25
outside the vehicle.

2
retary of Transportation to issue a notice of pro-
3
posed rulemaking to address protection of public 
4
transportation operators from the risk of assault.

(7) The Secretary of Transportation has failed 
6
