CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the Congress that State agencies 
and other providers of foster care services should make 
every effort to ensure siblings remain together in the 
foster system. 
Whereas sibling relationships are important and should be 
recognized and respected; 
Whereas sibling relationships provide needed continuity and 
stability during a child’s placement in foster care; 
Whereas the sibling bond is unique and separate from the 
parent-child bond, and may include relations with people 
not linked by blood; 
Whereas siblings share similar history, heritage, culture, and 
often biology;

Whereas the Fostering Connections to Success and Pro-
moting Adoption Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–351) re-
quires that States place siblings removed from their home 
in the same foster care, kinship guardianship, or adoptive 
placement, unless the State documents that such a joint 
placement would be contrary to the safety or well-being 
of any of the siblings; 
Whereas, in a case where siblings are removed from their 
home and not placed jointly, the State is to provide for 
their frequent visitation or interaction, unless the State 
documents that such a joint placement would be contrary 
to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings; 
Whereas sibling separation is a significant and distinct loss 
that must be ameliorated by frequent and regular con-
tact; and 
Whereas every foster child deserves the right to know and be 
actively involved in their siblings’ lives absent extraor-
dinary circumstances: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that 
2
State agencies and other providers of foster care services 
3
should— 
4
(1) make every effort to ensure that children 
5
are placed in homes with their siblings; 
6
(2) ensure that siblings who are not placed to-
7
gether are provided with ample opportunities to com-
8
municate with each other and remain connected; and
