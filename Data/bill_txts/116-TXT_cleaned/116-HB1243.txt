SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND CLI-
1
MATE CHANGE. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—The United States Global Change 
3
Research Program Climate and Health Assessment states 
4
that— 
5
(1) the impacts of human-induced climate 
6
change are increasing nationwide; 
7
(2) rising greenhouse gas concentrations result 
8
in increases in temperature, changes in precipitation, 
9
increases in the frequency and intensity of some ex-
10
treme weather events, and rising sea levels; 
11
(3) these climate change impacts endanger our 
12
health by affecting our food and water sources, the 
13
air we breathe, the weather we experience, and our 
14
interactions with the built and natural environments; 
15
and 
16
(4) as the climate continues to change, the risks 
17
to human health continue to grow. 
18
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
19
gress that— 
20
(1) climate change is real; 
21
(2) human activity significantly contributes to 
22
climate change; 
23
(3) climate change negatively impacts health;

ican organizations, and citizens, should use all prac-
7

mate change; 
16
(B) to ensure— 
17
(i) that the Nation’s public health and 
18
health care professionals have sufficient in-
19
formation to prepare for and respond to 
20
the adverse health impacts of climate

(iv) the improvement of health status 
16
and health equity through efforts to pre-
17
pare for and respond to climate change;

and 
19
(v) the inclusion of health impacts in
