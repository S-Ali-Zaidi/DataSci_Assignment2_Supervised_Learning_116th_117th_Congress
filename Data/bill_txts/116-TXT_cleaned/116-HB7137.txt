tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Police Reform Act of 
4
2020’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Law enforcement officers in the United 
8
States have always been appropriately empowered to 
9
use force, including deadly force, when necessary to 
10
apprehend suspects, protect public safety, and re-
11
spond to imminent threats. The use of force by law 
12
enforcement, however, must be exercised with due 
13
regard to constitutional limits, proportionality, 
14
norms of human dignity, and the importance of har-
15
monious police-community relations. 
16
(2) In recent years, community unrest has been 
17
sparked by incidents where law enforcement officers 
18
have used excessive or disproportionate force, failed 
19
to deescalate encounters with civilians, or failed to 
20

H7137

•HR 7137 IH
follow departmental policies and use-of-force mat-
1
rices, especially in communities of color. 
2
(3) Grassroots organizations like the National 
3
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, 
4
the American Civil Liberties Union, the National 
5
Council of La Raza, the National Urban League, 
6
National Congress of American Indians, and the Na-
7
tional Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium 
8
have monitored allegations of police misconduct, 
9
while membership organizations such as the Na-
10
tional Sheriffs’ Association, Fraternal Order of Po-
11
lice, and National Association of School Resource 
12
Officers have represented the interests of Federal, 
13
State, local, and Indian tribal law enforcement 
14
groups and with the civilian community on matters 
15
of common interest. 
16
(4) Where excessive or disproportionate force is 
17
employed by law enforcement officers, hostility is 
18
created between local communities and law enforce-
19
ment, reducing the effectiveness of efforts to reduce 
20
crime and promote public safety. 
21
(5) Police training in the United States is 
22
largely focused upon operational, investigatory, and 
23
tactical concerns, with less time and focus on issues 
24
02:36 Jul 11, 2020
H7137
4 
•HR 7137 IH
relating to proportionality in the use of force, de-es-
1
calation, and constitutional norms and limits. 
2
(6) Models for proportionate exercise of the use 
3
of force exist. For example, the Police Executive Re-
4
search Forum, a national organization of police offi-
5
cials, has developed guidelines advocating for a 
6
‘‘guardian’’ model for policing. These principles 
7
stress respect for human life, more restrictive stand-
8
ards for the use of force, proportionality and de-es-
9
calation techniques, and transparent and inde-
10
pendent post-action investigations. 
11
(7) The issues surrounding law enforcement use 
12
of force are especially difficult when it comes to po-
13
lice interactions with persons undergoing mental 
14
health crises, which occurs in as much as 20 percent 
15
of all police-civilian encounters. Law enforcement 
16
training too often fails to prepare officers to deal ef-
17
fectively and compassionately with people with men-
18
tal health disorders or partner with mental health 
19
crisis interventionists or specialists. 
20
(8) Programs promoting alternative responses 
21
to mental health calls, including Crisis Intervention 
22
Training (CIT) programs, have had a substantial 
23
positive impact on police interactions with those un-
24
dergoing a mental health crisis or persons with phys-
25
02:36 Jul 11, 2020
H7137

•HR 7137 IH
ical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities. In a 
1
CIT program, selected officers are trained to iden-
2
tify persons undergoing a crisis, employ de-esca-
3
lation techniques, and serve as liaison between police 
4
and mental health agencies, or partner with mental 
5
health responders outside the law enforcement agen-
6
cy. Studies have shown that CIT training is associ-
7
ated with reductions in arrests, increased diversions 
8
to mental health services, and positive changes in 
9
police attitudes and responses toward persons under-
10
going a mental health crisis. 
11
(9) Since 2017, the Federal Bureau of Inves-
12
tigation has administered the National Use-of-Force 
13
Data Collection, which seeks to compile data on po-
14
lice-civilian encounters that cause death or serious 
15
bodily injury, or where an officer discharges a weap-
16
on. Law enforcement officials have partnered with 
17
the FBI in creating this data collection method, in-
18
cluding the Association of State Criminal Investiga-
19
tive Agencies, Association of State Uniform Crime
