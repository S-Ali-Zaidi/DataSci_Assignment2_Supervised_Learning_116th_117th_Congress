Expressing support to designate the week of September 22 
through September 28, 2019, Rail Safety Week in the 
United States, and to support the goals and ideals of 
Rail Safety Week to reduce rail-related accidents, fatali-
ties, and injuries.

24 through September 30, 2017, by the national edu-
cation safety nonprofit Operation Lifesaver, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, and other organizations; 
Whereas Rail Safety Week was launched to raise awareness

and to highlight efforts to further reduce collisions, inju-
ries, and fatalities; 
Whereas the number of public crossings has decreased by 8 
percent, while the number of gates has increased by 26 
percent since 2005; 
Whereas, in 2018, 51 percent of all grade crossing collisions 
and 64 percent of all fatal grade crossing collisions oc-
curred at gated crossings; 
Whereas while grade crossing injuries are 13 percent higher, 
grade crossing fatalities are 6 percent higher, and grade 
crossing collisions are 15 percent higher since 2009; 
Whereas preliminary Federal statistics show that more than 
2,216 highway-grade crossing crashes occurred across the 
United States in 2018, resulting in 263 persons killed 
and another 840 injured; 
Whereas trespassing incidents on railroad property resulted 
in 541 persons killed and another 481 injured in 2018; 
Whereas highway-grade crossing crashes are more severe 
than highway collisions and are more likely to result in 
death and injury; 
Whereas many collisions between trains and motor vehicles or 
pedestrians could have been prevented by increased edu-
cation, engineering, and enforcement; 
Whereas Operation Lifesaver, the foremost public information 
and education program on rail safety, administers a pub-
lic education program about grade-crossing safety and 
trespassing prevention; 
Whereas during Rail Safety Week, from September 22 
through 28, and throughout the year, everyone is encour-

aged to take added caution as motorists or pedestrians 
approach tracks or trains; 
Whereas the United States and Canada will observe Rail 
Safety Week concurrently; and 
Whereas this important observance should lead to greater 
safety awareness and a reduction in highway-rail grade 
crossing crashes and pedestrian and railroad incidents: 
Now, therefore, be it
