To require certifications for transfers of certain United

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Middle East Advanced 
4
Military Technology Protection Act’’.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 8707 IH
(1) In June 2017, the Assistant Secretary of 
1
State for Political-Military Affairs testified to Con-
2
gress, ‘‘Arms transfers are foreign policy. When we 
3
transfer a system or a capability to a foreign part-
4
ner, we are affecting regional—or foreign internal— 
5
balances of power; we are sending a signal of sup-
6
port; and we are establishing or sustaining relation-
7
ships that may last for generations and provide ben-
8
efits for an extended period of time.’’. 
9
(2) For more than 50 years, the United States 
10
has worked to ensure Israel’s qualitative military 
11
edge when considering the sale or export of defense 
12
articles and defense services to Israel or to others in 
13
the Middle East region. 
14
(3) Maintaining a substantial qualitative mili-
15
tary edge is critical to preserving Israel’s safety and 
16
security and has been a vital consideration in all 
17
previous sales of weapons to the region. 
18
(4) Congress codified United States support for 
19
Israel’s qualitative military edge as United States 
20
policy in 2008 in section 201 of Public Law 110– 
21
429 (22 U.S.C. 2776 note), which requires that any 
22
proposed U.S. arms sale to ‘‘any country in the Mid-
23
dle East other than Israel’’ must include a notifica-
24
tion to Congress with a ‘‘determination that the sale 
25
18:58 Nov 20, 2020
H8707
3 
•HR 8707 IH
or export of such would not adversely affect Israel’s 
1
qualitative military edge over military threats to 
2
Israel’’. 
3
(5) In 2016, the United States and Israel 
4
signed a 10-year Memorandum of Understanding, in 
5
which the United States committed that ‘‘the acqui-
6
sition of additional U.S.-produced capabilities and 
7
technology provide the best means to ensure Israel 
8
preserves its Qualitative Military Edge (QME)’’. 
9
(6) In 2015, Vice President Joe Biden an-
10
nounced United States intention to transfer the F– 
11
35 Joint Strike Fighter to Israel: ‘‘What you may 
12
not know is that next year, we will deliver to Israel 
13
the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter—our finest—making 
14
Israel the only country in the Middle East with a 
15
fifth-generation aircraft. No other.’’. 
16
(7) In 2016, Israel received its first shipment of 
17
F–35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft and on the occa-
18
sion, the Israeli Defense Forces stated, ‘‘As the Mid-
19
dle East grows more and more unstable, and as 
20
groups that threaten to destroy us race to stockpile 
21
weapons, we need to stay a step ahead of the game. 
22
The F–35 gives us the edge we need to take on 
23
groups and armies with even the most advanced 
24
technology.’’.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
1
It shall be the policy of the United States that a pro-
2
posed sale or export of defense articles or defense services 
3
must be determined not to adversely affect Israel’s ability 
4
to counter and defeat any credible conventional military 
5
threat from any individual state or possible coalition of 
6
states or from non-state actors, while sustaining minimal 
7
damages and casualties, through the use of superior mili-
8
tary means possessed in sufficient quantity, including 
9
weapons, command, control, communication, intelligence, 
10
surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities that in their 
11
technical characteristics are superior in capability to those 
12
of such other individual state or possible coalition states 
13
or non-state actors, consistent with section 36(h) of the 
14
Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2776(h)).
