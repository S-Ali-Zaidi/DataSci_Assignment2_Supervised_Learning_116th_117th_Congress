RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of November 9, 2019, 
as ‘‘Gold Star Father’s Day’’. 
Whereas thousands of men and women have laid down their 
lives to defend the liberty and soul of our Nation, and 
families of fallen members of the Armed Forces have lost 
their loved ones in service to our country; 
Whereas families of members of the Armed Forces dem-
onstrate a different kind of heroism, supporting children 
and family members while loved ones are deployed, sacri-
ficing holidays with members who are serving overseas,

and facing each day knowing their loved one might be in 
danger and could never return home; 
Whereas, before the Iraq war, the United States had lost over 
1,300,000 members of the Armed Forces during wartime, 
and since October 2001, over 4,400 members of the 
Armed Forces have lost their lives serving this country, 
leaving thousands of family members behind; 
Whereas, in 2015, the Gold Star Fathers Act was signed into 
law to ensure Gold Star Fathers were eligible for the 
same benefits guaranteed to mothers of fallen or perma-
nently disabled members of the Armed Forces, honoring 
their sacrifice and loss, but this legislation did not des-
ignate a Gold Star Father’s Day; 
Whereas the last Sunday in September was designated by 
Congress as Gold Star Mother’s Day in 1936; 
Whereas President Donald Trump designated September 24, 
2017, as Gold Star Mother’s and Family’s Day, and in 
2016 President Barack Obama proclaimed September 25, 
2016, as Gold Star Mother’s and Family’s Day; 
Whereas the Georgia House of Representatives adopted 
House Resolution 723 on March 24, 2017, recognizing 
November 9 as Georgia Gold Star Father Day; 
Whereas Father’s Day honors and celebrates fatherhood and 
the unique paternal bonds between a father and his chil-
dren; and 
Whereas the goals of ‘‘Gold Star Father’s Day’’ on November 
9 are to— 
(1) honor and celebrate fathers who have lost chil-
dren in service to the United States of America;

their child[ren]: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports
