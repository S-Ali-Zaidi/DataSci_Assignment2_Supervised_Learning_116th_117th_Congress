Whereas in many countries, girls do not have the right of free 
speech or enjoy privileges afforded others in their respec-
tive societies, are exploited and attacked, and are sub-
jected to media pressure concerning how they should 
look, act, and feel; 
Whereas girls should be recognized for their positive and 
transformative role in shaping society and for overcoming 
obstacles of gender equality; 
Whereas the observation of the International Day of the Girl 
Child supports more opportunity for girls and increases 
awareness of gender inequality faced by girls worldwide 
based on their gender; and 
Whereas the observance of the International Day of the Girl 
Child in the United States may help build awareness of 
the challenges faced by girls worldwide and promote the 
end of gender discrimination: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
