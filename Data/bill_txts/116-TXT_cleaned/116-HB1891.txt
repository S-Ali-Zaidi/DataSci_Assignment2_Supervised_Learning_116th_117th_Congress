SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that— 
18
(1) White Sands National Monument was es-
19
tablished on January 18, 1933, by President Her-
20
bert Hoover under chapter 3203 of title 54, United 
21
States Code (commonly known as the ‘‘Antiquities 
22
Act of 1906’’); 
23
(2) President Hoover proclaimed that the 
24
Monument was established ‘‘for the preservation of 
25
23:05 Apr 06, 2019

•HR 1891 IH
the white sands and additional features of scenic, 
1
scientific, and educational interest’’; 
2
(3) the Monument was expanded by Presidents 
3
Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Carter, and Clinton in 1934, 
4
1942, 1953, 1978, and 1996, respectively; 
5
(4) the Monument contains a substantially 
6
more diverse set of nationally significant historical, 
7
archaeological, scientific, and natural resources than 
8
were known of at the time the Monument was estab-
9
lished, including a number of recent discoveries; 
10
(5) the Monument is recognized as a major unit 
11
of the National Park System with extraordinary val-
12
ues enjoyed by more visitors each year since 1995 
13
than any other unit in the State; 
14
(6) the Monument contributes significantly to 
15
the local economy by attracting tourists; and 
16
(7) designation of the Monument as a national 
17
park would increase public recognition of the diverse 
18
array of nationally significant resources at the 
19
Monument and visitation to the unit.
