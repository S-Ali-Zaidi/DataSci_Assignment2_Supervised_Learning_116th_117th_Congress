SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Point-in-time data collected by the Depart-
3
ment of Housing and Urban Development in 2018 
4
found that, nationally, on any given night, there are 
5
approximately 96,913 people who are experiencing 
6
chronic homelessness. Chronically homeless people 
7
often live in shelters or on the streets for years at 
8
a time, experience repeated episodes of homelessness 
9
without achieving housing stability, or cycle between 
10
homelessness, jails, mental health facilities, and hos-
11
pitals. 
12
(2) In 2003, the New Freedom Commission on 
13
Mental Health recommended the development and 
14
implementation of a comprehensive plan designed to 
15
facilitate access to 150,000 units of permanent sup-
16
portive housing for consumers and families who are 
17
chronically homeless. The Commission found that af-
18
fordable housing alone is insufficient for many peo-
19
ple with severe mental illness, and that flexible, mo-
20
bile, individualized support services are also nec-
21
essary to support and sustain consumers in their 
22
housing. 
23
(3) The United States Interagency Council on 
24
Homelessness (USICH), originally authorized by 
25
title II of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance

•HR 3272 IH
Act (42 U.S.C. 11311 et seq.) and reauthorized by 
1
the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid 
2
Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009 (di-
3
vision B of Public Law 111–22), is responsible for 
4
coordinating the Federal response to homelessness in 
5
cooperation with the Secretaries and senior leaders 
6
of the 19 Federal member agencies. Since the 
7
USICH’s implementation of ‘‘Opening Doors: Fed-
8
eral Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homeless-
9
ness’’, chronic homelessness in the United States 
10
has been reduced by 18 percent. 
11
(4) Research indicates that permanent sup-
12
portive housing is a cost-effective solution to chronic 
13
homelessness that leads to improved residential sta-
14
bility and reduction in psychiatric symptoms. Stud-
15
ies have also shown that supportive housing is asso-
16
ciated with significant reductions in costs for emer-
17
gency room visits, hospitalizations, shelters, sobering 
18
centers, jails, and other public services used by peo-
19
ple experiencing homelessness. 
20
(5) By implementing permanent supportive 
21
housing, communities are making progress toward 
22
ending chronic homelessness.
