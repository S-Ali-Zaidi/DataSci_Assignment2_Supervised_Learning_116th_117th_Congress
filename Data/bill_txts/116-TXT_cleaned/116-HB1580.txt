A BILL 
To enhance stabilization of conflict-affected areas and pre-
vent violence and fragility globally, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Fragility Act

of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following:

H1580

•HR 1580 IH
(1) According to the United Nations, an un-
1
precedented 68.5 million people around the world, 
2
the highest level ever recorded, are currently forcibly 
3
displaced from their homes. 
4
(2) According to the World Bank, violence and 
5
violent conflict are now the leading causes of dis-
6
placement and food insecurity worldwide, driving 80 
7
percent of humanitarian needs, with the same con-
8
flicts accounting for the majority of forcibly dis-
9
placed persons every year since 1991. 
10
(3) According to the Institute for Economics 
11
and Peace, violence containment costs the global 
12
economy $14.76 trillion a year, or 12.4 percent of 
13
the world’s GDP. 
14
(4) Violence and violent conflict underpin many 
15
of the United States Government’s key national se-
16
curity challenges. Notably, violent conflicts allow for 
17
environments in which terrorist organizations recruit 
18
and thrive, while the combination of violence, cor-
19
ruption, poverty, poor governance, and underdevelop-
20
ment often enables transnational gangs and criminal 
21
networks to wreak havoc and commit atrocities 
22
worldwide. 
23
(5) According to research by the University of 
24
Maryland and University of Pittsburgh, exposure to 
25
00:51 Mar 21, 2019
H1580
3 
•HR 1580 IH
violence increases support for violence and violent 
1
extremism. Research increasingly finds exposure to 
2
violence as a predictor of future participation in vio-
3
lence, including violent extremism. 
4
(6) United States foreign policy and assistance 
5
efforts in highly violent and fragile states remain 
6
governed by an outdated patchwork of authorities 
7
that prioritize responding to immediate needs rather 
8
than solving the problems that cause them. 
9
(7) Lessons learned over the past 20 years, doc-
10
umented by the 2013 Special Inspector General for 
11
Iraq Reconstruction Lessons Learned Study, the 
12
2016 Fragility Study Group report, and the 2018 
13
Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Lessons 
14
Learned Study on Stabilization, show that effective, 
15
sustained United States efforts to reduce violence 
16
and stabilize fragile and violence-affected states re-
17
quire clearly defined goals and strategies, adequate 
18
long-term funding, rigorous and iterative conflict 
19
analysis, coordination across the United States Gov-
20
ernment, including strong civil-military coordination, 
21
attention to the problem of corruption, and integra-
22
tion with and leadership from national and sub-na-
23
tional partners, including local civil society organiza-

tions, traditional justice systems, and local govern-
1
ance structures. 
2
(8) The ‘‘Stabilization Assistance Review’’ re-
3
leased in 2018 by the Departments of State and De-
4
fense and the United States Agency for Inter-
5
national Development states, ‘‘The United States 
6
has strong national security and economic interests 
7
in reducing levels of violence and promoting stability 
8
in areas affected by armed conflict.’’. The Review 
9
further states, ‘‘Stabilization is an inherently polit-
10
ical endeavor that requires aligning U.S. Govern-
11
ment efforts – diplomatic engagement, foreign as-
12
sistance, and defense – toward supporting locally le-
13
gitimate authorities and systems to peaceably man-
14
age conflict and prevent violence.’’. 
15
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
16
It is the policy of the United States to— 
17
(1) ensure that all relevant Federal depart-
18
ments and agencies coordinate to achieve coherent, 
19
long-term goals for programs designed to stabilize 
20
conflict-affected areas and prevent violence and fra-
21
gility globally, including when implementing the 
22
Global Fragility Initiative established pursuant to 
23
section 6; 
24
00:51 Mar 21, 2019
H1580

•HR 1580 IH
(2) seek to improve global, regional, and local 
1
coordination of relevant international and multilat-
2
eral development and donor organizations regarding 
3
efforts to stabilize conflict-affected areas and pre-
4
vent violence and fragility globally, and, where prac-
5
ticable and appropriate, align such efforts with mul-
6
tilateral goals and indicators; 
7
(3) expand and enhance the effectiveness of 
8
United States foreign assistance programs and ac-
9
tivities to stabilize conflict-affected areas and pre-
10
vent violence and fragility globally; 
11
(4) support the research and development of ef-
12
fective approaches to stabilize conflict-affected areas 
13
and prevent violence and fragility globally, and data 
14
collection efforts relevant to such approaches; and 
15
(5) improve the tools and authorities for assess-
16
ment, monitoring, and evaluation needed to enable 
17
learning and adaptation by such relevant Federal de-
18
partments and agencies working to stabilize conflict- 
19
affected areas and prevent violence and fragility
