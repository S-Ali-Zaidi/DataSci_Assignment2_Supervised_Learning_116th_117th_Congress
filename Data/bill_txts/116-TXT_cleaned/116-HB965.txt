Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) It is the policy of the United States to pro-
3
mote competition in the market for drugs and bio-
4
logical products by facilitating the timely entry of 
5
low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those 
6
drugs and biological products. 
7
(2) Since their enactment in 1984 and 2010, 
8
respectively, the Drug Price Competition and Patent 
9
Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98–417; 
10
98 Stat. 1585) and the Biologics Price Competition 
11
and Innovation Act of 2009 (subtitle A of title VII 
12
of Public Law 111–148; 124 Stat. 804), have pro-
13
vided pathways for making lower-cost versions of 
14
previously approved drugs and previously licensed bi-
15
ological products available to the people of the 
16
United States in a timely manner, thereby lowering 
17
overall prescription drug costs for patients and tax-
18
payers by billions of dollars each year. 
19
(3) In order for these pathways to function as 
20
intended, developers of generic drugs and biosimilar 
21
biological products (referred to in this section as 
22
‘‘generic product developers’’) must be able to obtain 
23
quantities of the reference listed drug or biological 
24
product with which the generic drug or biosimilar bi-
25
ological product is intended to compete (referred to 
26

•HR 965 IH
in this section as a ‘‘covered product’’) for purposes 
1
of supporting an application for approval by the 
2
Food and Drug Administration, including for testing 
3
to show that— 
4
(A) a prospective generic drug is bioequiva-
5
lent to the covered product in accordance with 
6
subsection (j) of section 505 of the Federal, 
7
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
8
355), or meets the requirements for approval of 
9
an application submitted under subsection 
10
(b)(2) of that section; or 
11
(B) a prospective biosimilar biological 
12
product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with 
13
its reference biological product under section 
14
351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 
15
U.S.C. 262(k)), as applicable. 
16
(4) For drugs and biological products that are 
17
subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, 
18
another essential component in the creation of low- 
19
cost generic and biosimilar versions of covered prod-
20
ucts is the ability of generic product developers to 
21
join the manufacturer of the covered product (re-
22
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘license holder’’) in 
23
a single, shared system of elements to assure safe 
24
use and supporting agreements as required by sec-

tion 505–1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
1
Act (21 U.S.C. 355–1), or secure a variance there-
2
from. 
3
(5) Contrary to the policy of the United States 
4
to promote competition in the market for drugs and 
5
biological products by facilitating the timely entry of 
6
lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those 
7
drugs and biological products, certain license holders 
8
are preventing generic product developers from ob-
9
taining quantities of the covered product necessary 
10
for the generic product developer to support an ap-
11
plication for approval by the Food and Drug Admin-
12
istration, including testing to show bioequivalence, 
13
biosimilarity, or interchangeability to the covered 
14
product, in some instances based on the justification 
15
that the covered product is subject to a risk evalua-
16
tion and mitigation strategy with elements to assure 
17
safe use under section 505–1 of the Federal Food, 
18
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355–1). 
19
(6) The Director of the Center for Drug Eval-
20
uation and Research of the Food and Drug Adminis-
21
tration has testified that some manufacturers of cov-
22
ered products have used risk evaluation and mitiga-
23
tion strategies and distribution restrictions adopted 
24
by the manufacturer on their own behalf as reasons 
25
22:03 Feb 16, 2019
H965
5 
•HR 965 IH
to not sell quantities of a covered product to generic 
1
product developers, causing barriers and delays in 
2
getting generic products on the market. The Food 
3
and Drug Administration has reported receiving sig-
4
nificant numbers of inquiries from generic product 
5
developers who were unable to obtain samples of cov-
6
ered products to conduct necessary testing and oth-
7
erwise meet requirements for approval of generic 
8
drugs. 
9
(7) In 2018, the Acting Chairman of the Fed-
10
eral Trade Commission testified that the Federal 
11
Trade Commission continues to be very concerned 
12
about potential abuses by manufacturers of brand 
13
drugs of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or 
14
other closed distribution systems to impede generic 
15
competition. 
16
(8) Also contrary to the policy of the United 
17
States to promote competition in the market for 
18
drugs and biological products by facilitating the 
19
timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar 
20
versions of those drugs and biological products, cer-
21
tain license holders are impeding the prompt nego-
22
tiation and development on commercially reasonable 
23
terms of a single, shared system of elements to as-
24
sure safe use, which may be necessary for the ge-

•HR 965 IH
neric product developer to gain approval for its drug 
1
or licensing for its biological product. 
2
(9) While the antitrust laws may address the 
3
refusal by some license holders to provide quantities 
4
of a covered product to a generic product developer, 
5
a more tailored legal pathway would help ensure 
6
that generic product developers can obtain necessary 
7
quantities of a covered product in a timely way for 
8
purposes of developing a generic drug or biosimilar 
9
biological product, facilitating competition in the 
10
marketplace for drugs and biological products. 
11
(10) The antitrust laws may address actions by 
12
license holders who impede the prompt negotiation 
13
and development of a single, shared system of ele-
14
ments to assure safe use, and the Food and Drug 
15
Administration has some authority to waive the re-
16
quirement of a single, shared system. Clearer regu-
17
latory authority to approve different systems that 
18
meet the statutory requirements to ensure patient 
19
safety, however, would limit the effectiveness of bad 
20
faith negotiations over single, shared systems to 
21
delay generic approval. At the same time, clearer 
22
regulatory authority would ensure all systems pro-
23
tect patient safety.
