SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Smart Manufacturing 
2
Leadership Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds that— 
5
(1) the industrial sector— 
6
(A) represents approximately 20 percent of 
7
the economy of the United States; 
8
(B) provides approximately 13 percent of 
9
employment in the United States; and 
10
(C) 
accounts 
for 
more 
than 
11
30,000,000,000,000,000 Btus of energy, a 
12
quantity that is equal to almost 1⁄3 of the en-
13
ergy consumption of the United States; 
14
(2) smart manufacturing is set to transform the 
15
manufacturing sector and the use by the manufac-
16
turing sector of energy, water, raw materials, and 
17
labor over the 10 years following the date of enact-
18
ment of this Act; 
19
(3) the transformation described in paragraph 
20
(2) will result in savings in electricity, natural gas, 
21
transportation fuels, chemical feedstocks, and many 
22
other fuels; 
23
(4) the interconnection of the many components 
24
of manufacturing within a manufacturing plant with 
25
other business functions within a company and 
26
22:17 Mar 26, 2019

•HR 1633 IH
across companies within a supply chain will enable 
1
new production efficiencies; 
2
(5) the improvements in automation described 
3
in paragraph (4) are estimated to produce between 
4
$5,000,000,000 and $25,000,000,000 in energy sav-
5
ings per year across the manufacturing sector for 
6
electricity alone by 2035; 
7
(6) smart manufacturing technologies are esti-
8
mated to add between $10,000,000,000,000 and 
9
$15,000,000,000,000 to the global gross domestic 
10
product over 20 years following the date of enact-
11
ment of this Act; 
12
(7) market barriers exist to the widespread 
13
adoption of smart manufacturing practices by all 
14
sizes of firms and to the investment in smart manu-
15
facturing technologies, including lack of— 
16
(A) common communication protocols be-
17
tween smart manufacturing devices, which pre-
18
vents interoperability, reduces system effi-
19
ciencies, and stifles innovation; 
20
(B) common standards for storing and 
21
sharing information relating to energy con-
22
sumption and energy savings; 
23
(C) an open-access smart manufacturing 
24
platform that enables the networking of busi-

ness and automation systems of multiple ven-
1
dors; and 
2
(D) common cybersecurity protocols and 
3
standards; 
4
(8) addressing the barriers described in para-
5
graph (7) is in the interest of the United States; 
6
(9) in response to the barriers described in 
7
paragraph (7), the Secretary of Energy is working 
8
with the private sector to reduce the market barriers 
9
through the development of voluntary protocols and 
10
standards; 
11
(10) there exist many technologies of which 
12
many domestic manufacturers are unaware that 
13
could— 
14
(A) improve the competitiveness of the do-
15
mestic manufacturers; and 
16
(B) reduce the environmental impacts of 
17
the domestic manufacturers; 
18
(11) Federal agency action can facilitate great-
19
er economic growth through outreach and engage-
20
ment in the smart manufacturing technology area; 
21
and 
22
(12) the United States would benefit from a 
23
concerted and focused effort to advance the adoption
