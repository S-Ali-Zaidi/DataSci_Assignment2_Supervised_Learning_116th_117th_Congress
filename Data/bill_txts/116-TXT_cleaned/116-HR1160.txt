RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 2020 
as ‘‘Pain Awareness Month’’ and recognizing the dis-
proportionate impact of migraine disease and headache 
disorders on women. 
Whereas approximately 36,000,000 Americans live with mi-
graine disease, more than have asthma or diabetes com-
bined, and 6,000,000 Americans experience chronic mi-
graine, a highly disabling neurological disorder and the 
second-leading cause of global disability; 
Whereas a migraine attack can cause severe throbbing pain 
or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head, 
which is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and ex-
treme sensitivity to light, sound, and smells;

Whereas migraine attacks can last for hours to days, with 
pain so severe that it interferes with daily activities and 
quality of life; 
Whereas the pain of cluster headache attacks is one of the 
most excruciating human experiences; 
Whereas persons living with migraine disease and headache 
disorders also experience significant stigma, often coming 
from friends, family, and coworkers; 
Whereas migraine disease affects approximately 28,000,000 
women in the United States, and 85 percent of those 
with chronic migraine are women; 
Whereas migraine disease and headache disorders are not 
only physical conditions that require living with chronic 
pain, but there is also the constant worry that these at-
tacks can strike at any moment, taking an emotional toll 
and increasing the likelihood of anxiety and depression; 
Whereas differences in diagnosis and treatment of headache 
and migraine disorders in Black, indigenous, and people 
of color communities may indicate racial and ethnic dis-
parities in access and quality of care for these patients; 
Whereas the physical pain of women is routinely dismissed by 
medical professionals and society as a whole, contributing 
to their pain and the cascading effects therefrom; 
Whereas the physical pain of women of color is routinely dis-
missed by medical professionals and society as a whole, 
contributing to their pain and the cascading effects there-
from; 
Whereas studies have shown that racial bias can affect how 
doctors assess and treat pain, including a 2016 study 
that showed trainees who believed that Black people are

not as sensitive to pain as White people were less likely 
to treat Black people’s pain appropriately; 
Whereas migraine disease is three times more common in 
women, reaching peak prevalence between 30 and 39 
years of age, at a time when many women are rapidly 
growing in their career and balancing work, family, and 
social obligations, further contributing to the wage gap; 
Whereas women account for a large majority of the estimated 
$78,000,000,000 in migraine-associated economic costs 
in the United States, representing about 80 percent of 
both direct medical costs and lost labor costs including 
presenteeism and absenteeism; 
Whereas migraine disease has significant negative con-
sequences for individuals, their families, and society as a 
whole; 
Whereas the National Institutes for Health (NIH) funded 
less than $40,000,000 in headache disorders research in 
fiscal year 2019, amounting to 0.1 percent of the total 
NIH budget, and comparisons with NIH funding of other 
diseases of similar disability and disease burden indicate 
that funding of headache disorders research should in-
stead exceed $200,000,000 each year; 
Whereas migraine disease and cluster headache are disabling 
diseases but largely symptomatic, without reliable diag-
nostic physical signs or lab findings, meaning that Fed-
eral regulations prohibiting claimant symptoms from sup-
porting SSDI/SSI eligibility as medically determinable 
impairments in sequential evaluation unfairly prevent 
their inclusion; and 
Whereas access to relief from cluster headache is often 
inexplicably limited by lack of insurance and Medicare
