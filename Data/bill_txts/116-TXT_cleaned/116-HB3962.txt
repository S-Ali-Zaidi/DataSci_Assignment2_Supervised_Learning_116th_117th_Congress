(b) FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.—

(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—

(A) energy costs for homeowners are a sig-
23
nificant and increasing portion of their house-
24
hold budgets; 
25

•HR 3962 IH
(B) household energy use can vary sub-
1
stantially depending on the efficiency and char-
2
acteristics of the house; 
3
(C) expected energy cost savings are im-
4
portant to the value of the house; 
5
(D) the current test for loan affordability 
6
used by most covered agencies, commonly 
7
known as the ‘‘debt-to-income’’ test, is inad-
8
equate because it does not take into account the 
9
expected energy cost savings for the homeowner 
10
of an energy efficient home; and 
11
(E) another loan limitation, commonly 
12
known as the ‘‘loan-to-value’’ test, is tied to the 
13
appraisal, which often does not adjust for effi-
14
ciency features of houses. 
15
(2) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this section 
16
are to— 
17
(A) improve the accuracy of mortgage un-
18
derwriting by Federal mortgage agencies by en-
19
suring that energy cost savings are included in 
20
the underwriting process as described below, 
21
and thus to reduce the amount of energy con-
22
sumed by homes and to facilitate the creation 
23
of energy efficiency retrofit and construction 
24
jobs;

(B) require a covered agency to include the 
1
expected energy cost savings of a homeowner as 
2
a regular expense in the tests, such as the debt- 
3
to-income test, used to determine the ability of 
4
the loan applicant to afford the cost of home-
5
ownership for all loan programs; and 
6
(C) require a covered agency to include the 
7
value home buyers place on the energy effi-
8
ciency of a house in tests used to compare the 
9
mortgage amount to home value, taking pre-
10
cautions to avoid double-counting and to sup-
11
port safe and sound lending.

WRITING CRITERIA.—

(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after

shall, in consultation with the advisory group estab-
17
lished in subsection (f)(2), develop and issue guide-
18

19
loan eligibility requirements, for use when testing 
20
the ability of a loan applicant to repay a covered 
21

22

7
agency and the mortgagee shall take into con-
8
sideration the estimated energy cost savings ex-
9
pected for the owner of the subject property in 
10

11
ficient income to service the mortgage debt plus 
12
other regular expenses. 
13
(B) EXPENSES AS OFFSETS.—To the ex-
14
tent that a covered agency uses a test such as 
15
a debt-to-income test that includes certain reg-
16

18
shall be included as an offset to these expenses.

COSTS.—Energy 
20
costs to be assessed include the cost of elec-
21
tricity, natural gas, oil, and any other fuel regu-
