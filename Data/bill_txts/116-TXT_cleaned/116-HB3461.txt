SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Community-based services play an essential 
3
role in keeping individuals healthy. 
4
(2) Without community-based long-term serv-
5
ices and supports, which are not typically covered by 
6
Medicare, seniors frequently experience negative 
7
health outcomes and lose their ability to live inde-
8
pendently. 
9
(3) Seniors who deplete their resources often 
10
have no option but to turn to Medicaid for coverage 
11
of long term care expenses. 
12
(4) Targeting community-based services and 
13
supports to at-risk seniors can help these individuals 
14
avoid depleting their assets and becoming Medicaid 
15
dependent.
