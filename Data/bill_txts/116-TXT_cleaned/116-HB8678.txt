SEC. 4. FINDINGS. 
8
Congress makes the following findings: 
9
(1) The majority of recent emerging infectious 
10
diseases have originated in wildlife. 
11
(2) There is a rise in zoonotic spillover events 
12
and outbreaks of such diseases. 
13
(3) This rise in such spillover events and out-
14
breaks relates to the increased interaction between 
15
human and wildlife. 
16
(4) There is a rise in interaction between 
17
human and wildlife related to deforestation, habitat 
18
degradation, and expansion into the habitat of such 
19
wildlife. 
20
(5) A serious risk factor for spillover events re-
21
lates to the collection, production, commercial trade, 
22
and sale of wildlife for human consumption. 
23
(6) Such a risk factor is increased if it involves 
24
wildlife that— 
25
22:50 Nov 07, 2020
H8678
6 
•HR 8678 IH
(A) does not ordinarily interact with hu-
1
mans; or 
2
(B) lives under a stressful condition as 
3
such condition exacerbates the shedding of 
4
zoonotic pathogens. 
5
(7) Markets for such wildlife to be sold for 
6
human consumption are found in many countries. 
7
(8) In some local, rural communities, such wild-
8
life is the only accessible source of high quality nu-
9
trition. 
10
(9) The public health emergency is an example 
11
of the human, economic, and security costs of global 
12
pandemics and regional epidemics of zoonotic dis-
13
eases and emerging infectious diseases. 
14
(10) The public health emergency may result 
15
in— 
16
(A) trillions of dollars in damage to the 
17
economy of the United States; and 
18
(B) hundreds of thousands of deaths of 
19
citizens. 
20
(11) PREDICT and PREDICT–2, previous 
21
zoonotic disease prevention programs, resulted in co-
22
operation over 10 years with more than 60 countries 
23
to strengthen zoonotic pathogen surveillance and
