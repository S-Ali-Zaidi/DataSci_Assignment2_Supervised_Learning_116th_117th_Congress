SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
1
It is the policy of the United States to promote effec-
2
tiveness, coordination, transparency, and accountability of 
3
international global health organizations, such as the 
4
World Health Organization (WHO), so that they will be 
5
more effective in catalyzing global and country actions to 
6
address health crises, especially with a view toward pre-
7
paring for, and responding to, global pandemics and 
8
transnational health emergencies. 
9
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress finds the following: 
11
(1) There is a compelling role for an inter-
12
national organization to help mitigate infectious dis-
13
eases that respect no national borders. 
14
(2) The World Health Organization (WHO) has 
15
played a critical role in addressing and mitigating 
16
infectious diseases, such as coordinating the Small-
17
pox Eradication Program (SEP) from 1966 through 
18
1980. 
19
(3) The 2017 National Security Strategy states 
20
that ‘‘Naturally emerging outbreaks of viruses such 
21
as Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, the 2003 SARS-CoV- 
22
1 outbreak, as well as the deliberate 2001 anthrax 
23
attacks in the United States, demonstrated the im-
24
pact of biological threats on national security by tak-
25
ing lives, generating economic losses, and contrib-

uting to a loss of confidence in government institu-
1
tions.’’. 
2
(4) The United States depends on an effective 
3
WHO to make good, well-informed public health de-
4
cisions to contain infectious diseases. 
5
(5) The SARS-CoV-2 or Coronavirus Disease 
6
2019 (commonly known as ‘‘COVID-19’’) pandemic 
7
appears to have originated in late 2019 in Wuhan, 
8
China. 
9
(6) Chinese officials initially reported to the 
10
WHO in January 2020 that there was no evidence 
11
that the COVID-19 pandemic was spread by human 
12
to human contact. 
13
(7) The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic co-
14
incided with the annual celebration of the Chinese 
15
New Year, which is the largest annual human mi-
16
gration in the world. 
17
(8) The Government of Taiwan, based on its 
18
own research, communicated to the WHO in Decem-
19
ber 2019 that COVID-19 pandemic was spread by 
20
human to human contact. 
21
(9) The WHO disregarded the more accurate 
22
information from the Government of Taiwan because 
23
of anti-Taiwan animus driven by malign influence of 
24
the Government of the People’s Republic of China.

•HR 6915 IH
(10) The Government of the People’s Republic 
1
of China had actively campaigned for Tedros 
2
Adhanom Ghebreyesus to be selected as Director- 
3
General of the WHO, and exerts influence on him. 
4
(11) With the onset of the COVID-19 pan-
5
demic, the Government of the People’s Republic of 
6
China provided factually inaccurate information to 
7
the WHO and Director-General Ghebreyesus, result-
8
ing in the spread of disinformation globally about 
9
the pandemic. 
10
(12) Initial recommendations by the WHO at 
11
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019 
12
and early 2020 advising countries against carrying 
13
out travel restrictions to and from the affected areas 
14
resulted in a much wider spread of the disease, and 
15
severely limited the ability of the international com-
16
munity to contain the virus. 
17
(13) During the onset of the COVID-19 pan-
18
demic, the WHO’s effectiveness was diminished be-
19
cause its leadership appears to have put political 
20
considerations over its public health mandate, and 
21
the WHO transmitted inaccurate and misleading in-
22
formation regarding the communicability of the 
23
novel coronavirus to member states. 
24
22:34 Jun 08, 2020
H6915

•HR 6915 IH
(14) WHO member states relied on inaccurate 
1
and misleading information regarding transmission 
2
of COVID-19 supplied by the WHO and used this 
3
information to formulate their responses, resulting 
4
in a significantly higher number of infected people 
5
and loss of life. 
6
(15) The United States and other countries 
7
have a compelling humanitarian interest in com-
8
prehensively and objectively investigating and report-
9
ing on the WHO’s COVID-19 pandemic record, in-
10
cluding any failures. The United States has a broad 
11
interest in promoting transparency and account-
12
ability in United Nations agencies and other inter-
13
national organizations, including regional arms of 
14
the WHO such as the Pan American Health Organi-
15
zation. 
16
(16) The United States needs to investigate the 
17
causes of this failure at the WHO, and promote 
18
transparency and accountability, in order to improve 
19
the capacity of the WHO to address future 
20
pandemics.
