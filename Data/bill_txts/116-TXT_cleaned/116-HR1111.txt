RESOLUTION 
Supporting the people of Belarus and their democratic aspi-
rations and condemning the election rigging and subse-
quent violent crackdowns on peaceful protestors by the 
Government of the Republic of Belarus. 
Whereas the Republic of Belarus held a presidential election 
on August 9, 2020, that was widely considered to be nei-
ther free nor fair; 
Whereas official election results released by Belarusian gov-
ernment officials and the unofficial exit polls conducted 
by domestic observers and members of civil society pre-
sented substantially divergent data;

Whereas in the months leading up to the election, Belarusian 
authorities had arbitrarily detained over 1,300 people, in-
cluding activists and journalists participating in peaceful 
protests; 
Whereas within the first 5 days of the protests following the 
August 9th election, nearly 7,000 peaceful protestors and 
journalists had been detained in Belarus; 
Whereas, as of September 1, 2020, the United Nations Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had re-
ceived 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment 
by detainees; 
Whereas these peaceful demonstrations were met with vio-
lence from security services that employed barricades, 
stun grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets, and, at times, live 
ammunition; 
Whereas Amnesty International and local human rights 
groups said they have ‘‘collected horrifying testimonies 
from protesters in Belarus who describe being tortured or 
subjected to other ill-treatment in detention centers, in-
cluding being stripped naked, beaten, and threatened 
with rape’’; 
Whereas, as of August 25, 2020, dozens of protestors re-
mained missing and at least 4 Belarusians had been 
killed in violence related to the demonstrations; 
Whereas Belarusians continue to share real-time videos and 
other content documenting the brutal crackdown on 
peaceful demonstrations through social media; 
Whereas, on August 30, 2020, the Government of Belarus re-
voked the accreditation of 19 international journalists 
and deported 2 others;

•HRES 1111 IH 
Whereas in the days and weeks that followed, a grassroots 
movement of Belarusians has demonstrated against the 
official electoral results and demanded new elections; 
Whereas demonstrators have included people from all parts 
of Belarusian society, including men, women, and chil-
dren, students and workers, the young and the old, and 
police officers who quit their service in the wake of the 
protests; 
Whereas women have played a critical role in the protest 
movement in Belarus as demonstrators rallied behind 3 
key female opposition leaders and women have gathered 
and marched together across the country; 
Whereas across the Republic of Belarus, workers from state- 
owned companies and factories have gone on strike in sol-
idarity with the demonstrators; 
Whereas, on August 23, 2020, it is estimated that nearly 
200,000 protestors gathered in Minsk, making it the 
largest protest in Belarusian history; 
Whereas the constitution of Belarus provides that the people 
of Belarus recognize themselves as ‘‘a full-fledged subject 
of the international community’’ and believe in their ‘‘in-
alienable right to self-determination’’; and 
Whereas daily peaceful protests continue across the country 
as demonstrators can be heard chanting the lyrics of the 
demonstrators’ unofficial campaign song: ‘‘Our hearts are 
longing for changes; Our eyes are longing for changes; 
It’s in our laugh and in our tears; And it’s pulsing 
through our veins; Changes, we are longing for 
changes.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
