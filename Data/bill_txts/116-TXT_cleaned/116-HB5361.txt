SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) safe and clean drinking water is essential to 
3
the health, well-being, comfort, and standard of liv-
4
ing of every person of the United States; 
5
(2) emerging contaminants in drinking water 
6
systems are increasingly being detected at low levels; 
7
(3) prolonged exposure to unregulated drinking 
8
water contaminants, including emerging contami-
9
nants, may pose human health risks, particularly to 
10
vulnerable populations; 
11
(4) the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 
12
300f et seq.) requires the Administrator of the Envi-
13
ronmental Protection Agency— 
14
(A) to periodically make regulatory deter-
15
minations with respect to unregulated contami-
16
nants; and 
17
(B) not less frequently than once every 5 
18
years, to identify and publish a description of 
19
unregulated contaminants that may require reg-
20
ulation; 
21
(5) in a 2011 report of the Government Ac-
22
countability Office, the Comptroller General of the 
23
United States found, with respect to unregulated 
24
drinking water contaminants, that— 
25
18:34 Dec 12, 2019
H5361
3 
•HR 5361 IH
(A) the Administrator has made limited 
1
progress in prioritizing drinking water contami-
2
nants based on greatest public health concern; 
3
(B) the lack of data relating to the expo-
4
sure of the public to potentially harmful drink-
5
ing water contaminants and the related health 
6
effects of that exposure continues to limit the 
7
ability of the Administrator to make regulatory 
8
determinations; and 
9
(C) in many cases, gathering sufficient 
10
data to address contaminants awaiting regu-
11
latory determinations by the Administrator has 
12
taken the Administrator more than 10 years, 
13
and obtaining data on other contaminants that 
14
are currently awaiting regulatory determina-
15
tions may take decades; 
16
(6) in the 2016 Drinking Water Action Plan of 
17
the Environmental Protection Agency, the Adminis-
18
trator recommended that the Federal Government 
19
and key water stakeholders strengthen the effective-
20
ness of drinking water health advisories through en-
21
hanced collaboration and increased focus on risk 
22
management and risk communication approaches; 
23

24
on Appropriations of the Senate accompanying S.

•HR 5361 IH
1662 of the 115th Congress (S. Rept. 115–139), the 
1
Office of Science and Technology Policy developed a 
2
coordinated cross-agency plan for addressing critical 
3
research gaps related to detecting, assessing expo-
4
sure to, and identifying the adverse health effects of 
5
emerging contaminants in drinking water; and 
6
(8) it is vital that legislators, regulatory offi-
7
cials, public water system owners and operators, sci-
8
entists, and environmental advocacy groups continue 
9
to work to ensure that the public water systems of 
10
the United States are among the safest in the world.
