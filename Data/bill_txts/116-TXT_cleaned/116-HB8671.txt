(a) DEFINITION OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL.— 
4
In this section, the term ‘‘carbon dioxide removal’’ means 
5
the capture of carbon dioxide directly from ambient air 
6
or, in dissolved form, from seawater, combined with the 
7
sequestration of such carbon dioxide, including through— 
8
(1) direct air capture and sequestration; 
9
(2) enhanced carbon mineralization; 
10
(3) bioenergy with carbon capture and seques-
11
tration; 
12
(4) forest restoration; 
13
(5) soil carbon management; and 
14
(6) direct ocean capture.
