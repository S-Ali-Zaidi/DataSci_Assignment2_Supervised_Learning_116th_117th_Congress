SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 8436 IH
(1) In 1966, Martin Luther King, Jr., said, ‘‘Of 
1
all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care 
2
is the most shocking and inhuman because it often 
3
results in physical death.’’. 
4
(2) Inequality in health care remains a per-
5
sistent and devastating reality for many commu-
6
nities, but, in particular, communities of color. 
7
(3) Unequal health care has complex causes, 
8
many stemming from systemic inequality in access 
9
to health care, housing, nutrition, economic oppor-
10
tunity, education, and other factors. 
11
(4) Health care outcomes for African-American 
12
communities in particular lag far behind those of the 
13
population as a whole. 
14
(5) Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National 
15
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on 
16
April 7, 2020, the coronavirus outbreak is ‘‘shining 
17
a bright light’’ on ‘‘unacceptable’’ health disparities 
18
in the African-American community. 
19
(6) A contributing factor in health disparities is 
20
explicit and implicit bias in the delivery of health 
21
care, resulting in inferior care and poorer outcomes 
22
for some patients on the basis of race or ethnicity. 
23
(7) The Institute of Medicine issued a report in 
24
2002 titled ‘‘Unequal Treatment’’, finding that ra-
25

•HR 8436 IH
cial and ethnic minorities receive lower-quality 
1
health care than Whites do, even when insurance 
2
status, income, age, and severity of condition is com-
3
parable. 
4
(8) Just as Congress has sought to eliminate 
5
bias, both explicit and implicit, in employment, hous-
6
ing, and other parts of our society, the elimination 
7
of bias and the legacy of structural racism in health 
8
care is of paramount importance.
