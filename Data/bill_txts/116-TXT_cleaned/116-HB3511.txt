SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Transforming Student 
2
Debt to Home Equity Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) In the first quarter of 2019, over 
6
16,800,000 homes remain vacant in the United 
7
States. 
8
(2) These extended vacancies depress neighbor-
9
hood property values and create a downward spiral 
10
in neighborhood stability in already troubled commu-
11
nities. 
12
(3) Meanwhile, due to climbing expenses of 
13
higher education, the total Federal student debt 
14
owed equals $1,560,000,000,000. 
15
(4) More than 44,700,000 Americans have at 
16
least one outstanding student loan, up dramatically 
17
from 37,000,000 Americans just 7 years ago. 
18
(5) Student loan repayments are forcing mil-
19
lions of young families out of purchasing their first 
20
home, as they cannot afford to save for a down pay-
21
ment or qualify for a mortgage. 
22
(6) Data from the United States Census Bu-
23
reau shows that non-Hispanic White households 
24
have an average net worth of $130,800, while Black 
25
households have an average net worth of $9,590 and 
26
03:02 Jul 10, 2019
H3511

•HR 3511 IH
Hispanic households have $17,530; providing inno-
1
vative financial products will allow the United States 
2
to close the racial wealth gap and to ensure equi-
3
table access to housing and economic mobility. 
4
(7) According to a report from Pew Research 
5
Center, the median income of African-American 
6
households decreased by 53 percent between 2008 
7
and 2013. In the same time period, the income gap 
8
between White households and African-American 
9
households widened; increasing from 13 times great-
10
er to 17 times greater. 
11
(8) It is imperative to create a demonstration 
12
program to design financial pathways to, where pos-
13
sible, to systematically convert some student debt 
14
streams into equity streams through negotiation of 
15
mortgages; otherwise housing purchases will con-
16
tinue to be sluggish among first time home-buyers 
17
and thousands more Americans will enter their mid-
18
years saddled with student loan debt never having 
19
had the opportunity to accumulate equity. 
20
(9) It is in the interest of the Federal Govern-
21
ment to use the resources at its disposal, including 
22
both housing properties held in trust and student 
23
debt obligations, to put reverse pressure on these 
24
downward trends.

(10) By arranging financing that recalculates 
1
terms, debt-to-income ratios, mortgage interest 
2
rates, and other factors, short-term student debt 
3
could transition into longer term home ownership. 
4
(11) The goal is to connect creditworthy Fed-
5
eral student debt holders with housing properties for 
6
sale and held by the Federal Government and local 
7
land banks. 
8
(12) Over time, participants can help restore 
9
neighborhoods, transform their debt to equity, and 
10
stabilize secured property values locally and on the 
11
Federal ledger by maintaining and investing in a 
12
home mortgage.
