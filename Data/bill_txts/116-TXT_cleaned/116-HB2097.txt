ognition and Unexploded Ordnance Removal Act’’.

SEC. 2. RECOGNITION OF HMONG, KHMER, LAOTIAN,

MONTAGNARDS, 
AND 
OTHER 
ETHNIC

GROUPS WHO SUPPORTED AND DEFENDED

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Many Hmong, Khmer, Laotian, and 
9
Montagnards— 
10
(A) fought and died with United States 
11
Armed Forces during the conflict in Southeast 
12
Asia in the 1960s and 1970s; 
13
(B) rescued United States pilots shot down 
14
in enemy-controlled territory and returned the 
15
pilots to safety; 
16
(C) captured and destroyed enemy supplies 
17
and prevented enemy forces from using the sup-
18
plies to kill members of the United States 
19
Armed Forces; 
20
(D) gathered and provided to the United 
21

23
(E) provided food, shelter, and support to 
24
the United States Armed Forces.

(2) The National Armed Forces of Cambodia 
1
facilitated the evacuation of the United States Em-
2
bassy in Phnom Penh on April 12, 1975, by con-
3
tinuing to fight Khmer Rouge forces as they ad-
4
vanced upon the capital. 
5
(3) A tragic legacy of the conflict in Southeast 
6
Asia is the lethal risk posed by unexploded ordnance 
7
(UXO) in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia that still 
8
litter forests, rice fields, villages, school grounds, 
9
roads, and other populated areas—hindering devel-
10
opment and poverty reduction efforts. 
11
(4) Vietnam remains one of the world’s most 
12
contaminated countries, with an estimated 800,000 
13
tons of UXO left over from the conflict in Southeast 
14
Asia that ended more than 40 years ago. It has 
15
caused more than 100,000 casualties, including 
16
40,000 deaths. 
17
(5) From 1964–1973, the United States 
18
dropped more than 2,000,000 tons of bombs on 
19
Laos during American operations to disrupt North 
20
Vietnamese military supply routes. As a result, Laos 
21
is the most heavily bombed country per capita in the 
22
world. Much of the country’s land remains contami-
23
nated with more than 80,000,000 small, unexploded 
24
cluster munitions. Since the end of the conflict, 
25

•HR 2097 IH
UXO have injured or killed more than 25,000 civil-
1
ians in Laos. 
2
(6) Cambodia suffers from one of the highest 
3
rates of landmine and UXO accidents in the world. 
4
Over 64,000 Cambodians have been killed or injured 
5
by unexploded ordnance and other explosive rem-
6
nants of war since 1979, with an average of one cas-
7
ualty every week. 
8
(7) The United States is the world’s leading fi-
9
nancial supporter of conventional weapons destruc-
10
tion worldwide. Since 1993, the United States has 
11
provided more than $3,400,000,000 in assistance to 
12
more than 100 countries, including more than 
13
$132,000,000 in Vietnam, $200,000,000 in Laos, 
14
and $140,000,000 in Cambodia. 
15
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
16
gress that— 
17
(1) 
the 
Hmong,

19
for their support and defense of the Armed Forces 
20
and freedom during the conflict in Southeast Asia; 
21
and 
22
(2) the United States should continue to sup-
23
port activities to clear unexploded ordnance and 
24
other explosive remnants of war in Vietnam, Laos,
