•HR 4319 IH
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Immigrant Witness 
4
and Victim Protection Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. PURPOSE; FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to remove 
7
barriers for alien survivors of domestic violence, sexual as-
8
sault, human trafficking, and other crimes who may be 
9
eligible for protections under the Violence Against Women 
10
Act of 1994 (VAWA), the Trafficking Victims Protection 
11
Act of 2000 (TVPA). 
12
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
13
(1) Threats of deportation are one of the most 
14
potent tools abusers and perpetrators of crime use 
15
to maintain control over and silence alien victims 
16
and to avoid criminal prosecution. Abusers and per-
17
petrators leverage the immigration system in the 
18
abuse and exploitation of aliens they victimize. 
19
(2) A bipartisan majority in Congress created 
20
critical immigration protections in VAWA, TVPA 
21
and their subsequent reauthorizations in recognition 
22
that alien survivors of domestic violence, sexual as-
23
sault, human trafficking, and other eligible crimes

•HR 4319 IH
often fear that reaching out for help may lead to 
1
their deportation. 
2
(3) Detention and removal of those with victim- 
3
based cases undermines the intent of VAWA and re- 
4
traumatizes victims and their children. Deporting 
5
survivors while they await decisions on their cases 
6
discourages victims from accessing justice, under-
7
mines the usefulness of these forms of relief as tools 
8
for law enforcement that seek to keep all commu-
9
nities safe, separates them from their children and 
10
support networks, and eliminates the ability of local 
11
law enforcement to continue protecting and working 
12
with such crime survivors. 
13
(4) Lack of timely access to employment au-
14
thorization makes victims more vulnerable and likely 
15
to need to endure or return to abusive relationships 
16
or exploitative conditions. Crime survivors should 
17
have access to work authorization to escape abusive 
18
situations, and gain self-sufficiency following victim-
19
ization so they can support themselves and their 
20
children. 
21
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
22
gress that the Secretary of Homeland Security should not 
23
deport crime victims before their applications for humani-

WITH PENDING PETITIONS AND APPLICA-

Section 236 of the Immigration and Nationality Act

(8 U.S.C. 1226) is amended by adding at the end the fol-

‘‘(a) PROHIBITION ON DETENTION OF CERTAIN VIC-

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other

provision of this Act, there shall be a presumption 
10
that the alien described in paragraph (2) should be 
11
released from detention. The Secretary of Homeland 
12
Security shall have the duty of rebutting this pre-
13
sumption, which may only be shown based on clear 
14
and convincing evidence, including credible and indi-
15
vidualized information, that the use of alternatives

to detention will not reasonably ensure the appear-

ance of the alien at removal proceedings, or that the

alien is a threat to another person or the commu-
