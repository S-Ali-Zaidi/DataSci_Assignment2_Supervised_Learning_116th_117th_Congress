RESOLUTION 
Condemning the false, inflammatory, and racially offensive 
statements made by the President of the United States 
regarding four women of color who are duly elected Mem-
bers of the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress. 
Whereas, on November 6, 2018, in an election widely re-
garded as a referendum on the performance and dis-
approval of the administration of President Donald J. 
Trump, the American people voted to vest control of the 
House of Representatives in the Democratic Party to re-
store the system of checks and balances designed by the 
Framers in 1787 in Philadelphia; 
Whereas the Representatives elected to the One Hundred Six-
teenth Congress comprise the most diverse class in Amer-
ican history with respect to its racial, ethnic, and reli-

gent of female Representatives and the most Members 
ever of the LGBTQ community; 
Whereas among the cohort of the 40 Representatives first 
elected to the Congress in the November 2018 election 
are several whose membership is historic, including the 
Representative for the 7th District of Massachusetts, the 
first African-American woman elected from the Common-
wealth of Massachusetts; the Representative from the 
13th District of Michigan, the first Palestinian-American 
woman elected to Congress; the Representative from the 
14th District of New York, the youngest woman ever 
elected to Congress; and the Representative from the 5th 
District of Minnesota, the first Somali-American elected 
to Congress; 
Whereas in the discharge of their official duties as Members 
of Congress, the aforementioned Representatives traveled 
to the southern border of the United States to observe 
the living conditions and treatment received by migrants 
and refugees seeking asylum in the United States who 
are currently being held in detention facilities, some con-
sisting of nothing more than tent villages cordoned off 
under highways; 
Whereas the migrants and refugees being detained sought 
refuge in the United States for the same reasons as the 
tens of millions who came before them, in this century 
and the last, from this continent and from every other 
and from all corners of the globe; 
Whereas the migrants and refugees being detained sought 
refuge in the United States to be free of fear and hunger, 
to better their condition, to begin their world anew, and 
to give their children a chance for a better life, seeking

to leave the pain of the Old World for the hope and 
promise of the New World; 
Whereas upon their return to the capital, the aforementioned 
Representatives reported their shock and horror regard-
ing the inhumane conditions to which detainees were 
being subjected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion at a public hearing of a standing committee of the 
House of Representatives; 
Whereas, on July 14, 2019, the President of the United 
States reacted to the criticism of his administration’s 
treatment of detainees by the aforementioned Represent-
atives in a series of tweets that questioned their loyalty 
to the United States and implied that the circumstances 
of their birth gave them no right to exercise the respon-
sibilities and privileges of duly elected Members of Con-
gress; 
Whereas the President tweeted about the aforementioned 
Representatives: ‘‘So interesting to see ‘Progressive’ 
Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from 
countries whose governments are a complete and total ca-
tastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in 
the world (if they even have a functioning government at 
all), now loudly . . . and viciously telling the people of 
the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation 
on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don’t 
they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime 
infested places from which they came’’; 
Whereas the President’s statements are false, inflammatory, 
and racially offensive and unbecoming the Nation’s chief 
executive;

Whereas the recent statements of the President are inac-
curate and offensive but consistent with prior statements 
he has made to stoke division, discord, and disharmony 
among the American people; 
Whereas the current President of the United States bur-
nished his political reputation by claiming falsely for 
more than five years that his predecessor was born in 
Kenya and not the United States and thus was an illegit-
imate President; 
Whereas the current President of the United States launched 
his 2016 campaign for the Presidency said of persons 
from Mexico seeking to immigrate to the United States: 
‘‘They‘re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re 
rapists.’’; 
Whereas the current President of the United States claimed 
that a Hispanic Federal jurist could not preside over a 
court proceeding to which he was a defendant accused of 
civil fraud because ‘‘He’s a Mexican’’; 
Whereas in January 2018, the current President of the 
United States is reported to have inquired of his advi-
sors: ‘‘Why are we having all these people from shithole 
countries come here?’’, referring to persons from coun-
tries in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and South 
America; 
Whereas, on August 15, 2017, the current President of the 
United States said he regarded as some ‘‘very fine peo-
ple’’ the neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and Ku Klux 
Klansmen who descended on the peaceful community of 
Charlottesville, Virginia, to advocate racism and who 
were met by peaceful counterprotesters;

Whereas in his continuous and determined effort to exacer-
bate ethnic tensions and racial divisions in the body poli-
tic, the current President of the United States is reveal-
ing himself to be an unwitting instrument of the plan 
hatched in Moscow by Russian Federation President 
Vladimir Putin to interfere in the 2016 Presidential cam-
paign to help elect his preferred candidate and sow dis-
cord and division among the American people; and 
Whereas statements and actions of the current President of 
the United States demean the Office he holds and falls 
short of the standard set by the 16th President, whose 
administration was devoted to unity, healing, and ending 
racial division and who famously foretold in his March 4, 
1861, Inaugural Address the reasons why the efforts of 
the current President of the United States are destined 
to fail: ‘‘We are not enemies, but friends. We must not 
be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must 
not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of 
memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will 
be, by the better angels of our nature.’’: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
