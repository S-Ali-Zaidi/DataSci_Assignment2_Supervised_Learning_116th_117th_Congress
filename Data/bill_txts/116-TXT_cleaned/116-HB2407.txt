SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Children are entitled to special protections 
3
and due process rights under international human 
4
rights law and international humanitarian law, re-
5
gardless of guilt or innocence or the gravity of an al-
6
leged offense. 
7
(2) The Government of Israel and its military 
8
detains around 500 to 700 Palestinian children be-
9
tween the ages of 12 and 17 each year and pros-
10
ecutes them before a military court system that 
11
lacks basic and fundamental guarantees of due proc-
12
ess in violation of international standards. 
13
(3) Israel has ratified the Convention on the 
14
Rights of the Child, which states— 
15
(A) in article 37(a), that ‘‘no child shall be 
16
subject to torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
17
degrading treatment or punishment’’; 
18
(B) in article 37(b), that the arrest, deten-
19
tion or imprisonment of a child ‘‘shall be used 
20
only as a measure of last resort and for the 
21
shortest appropriate period of time’’; 
22
(C) in article 37(c), that ‘‘every child de-
23
prived of liberty shall be treated with humanity 
24
and respect for the inherent dignity of the 
25
human person, and in a manner which takes 
26
01:45 May 02, 2019
H2407
3 
•HR 2407 IH
into account the needs of persons of his or her 
1
age’’; and 
2
(D) in article 37(d), that ‘‘[e]very child de-
3
prived of his or her liberty shall have the right 
4
to prompt access to legal and other appropriate 
5
assistance, as well as the right to challenge the 
6
legality of the deprivation of his or her liberty 
7
before a court or other competent, independent 
8
and impartial authority, and to a prompt deci-
9
sion on any such action’’. 
10
(4) In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, there 
11
are two separate legal systems, with Israeli military 
12
law imposed on Palestinians and Israeli civilian law 
13
applied to Israeli settlers. 
14
(5) Approximately 2,900,000 Palestinians live 
15
in the West Bank, of which around 45 percent are 
16
children under the age of 18, who have lived their 
17
entire lives under Israeli military occupation. 
18
(6) Since 2000, more than 10,000 Palestinian 
19
children have been subject to the Israeli military 
20
court system. 
21
(7) Israeli security forces detain children under 
22
the age of 12 for interrogation for extended periods 
23
of time even though prosecution of children under 
24
12 is prohibited by Israeli military law.

(8) Human Rights Watch, in its World Report 
1
2018, reported that Israeli Security Forces detained 
2
Palestinian children ‘‘often using unnecessary force, 
3
questioned them without a family member present, 
4
and made them sign confessions in Hebrew, which 
5
most did not understand’’. 
6
(9) Human Rights Watch documented, in a 
7
July 2015 report titled ‘‘Israel: Security Forces 
8
Abuse Palestinian Children’’, that such detentions 
9
also included the use of chokeholds, beatings, and 
10
coercive interrogation on children between the ages 
11
of 11 and 15 years. 
12
(10) The Israeli human rights organization 
13
B’Tselem issued a report in 2018 describing the 
14
treatment of Palestinian children under Israeli mili-
15
tary occupation: ‘‘Every year, hundreds of Pales-
16
tinian minors undergo the same scenario. Israeli se-
17
curity forces pick them up on the street or at home 
18
in the middle of the night, then handcuff and blind-
19
fold them and transport them to interrogation, often 
20
subjecting them to violence en route. Exhausted and 
21
scared—some having spent a long time in transit, 
22
some having been roused from sleep, some having 
23
had nothing to eat or drink for hours—the minors 
24
are then interrogated. They are completely alone in 
25
01:45 May 02, 2019
H2407

•HR 2407 IH
there, cut off from the world, without any adult they 
1
know and trust by their side, and without having 
2
been given a chance to consult with a lawyer before 
3
the interrogation. The interrogation itself often in-
4
volves threats, yelling, verbal abuse and sometimes 
5
physical violence. Its sole purpose is to get the mi-
6
nors to confess or provide information about oth-
7
ers.’’. 
8
(11) The United Nations Children’s Fund 
9
(UNICEF) concluded, in a February 2013 report ti-
10
tled ‘‘Children in Israeli Military Detention’’, that 
11
the ‘‘ill-treatment of children who come in contact 
12
with the military detention system appears to be 
13
widespread, 
systematic 
and 
institutionalized 
14
throughout the process, from the moment of arrest 
15
until the child’s prosecution and eventual conviction 
16
and sentencing’’. 
17
(12) The 2013 UNICEF report further deter-
18
mines that the Israeli system of military detention of 
19
Palestinian children profoundly deviates from inter-
20
national norms, stating that ‘‘in no other country 
21
are children systematically tried by juvenile military 
22
courts that, by definition, fall short of providing the 
23
necessary guarantees to ensure respect for their 
24
rights’’. 
25
01:45 May 02, 2019
H2407

•HR 2407 IH
(13) UNICEF also released reports in October 
1
2013 and February 2015 noting that Israeli authori-
2
ties have, since March 2013, issued new military or-
3
ders and taken steps to reinforce existing military 
4
and police standard operating procedures relating to 
5
the detention of Palestinian children. However, the 
6
reports still found continued and persistent evidence 
7
of ill-treatment of Palestinian children detained by 
8
Israeli forces. 
9
(14) In 2013, the annual Country Report on 
10
Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied 
11
Territories (‘‘Annual Report’’) published by the De-
12
partment of State noted that Israeli security services 
13
continued to abuse, and in some cases torture mi-
14
nors, frequently arrested on suspicion of stone- 
15
throwing, in order to coerce confessions. The torture 
16
tactics used included threats, intimidation, long-term 
17
handcuffing, beatings, and solitary confinement. 
18
(15) The State Department’s 2013 Annual Re-
19
port also stated that ‘‘signed confessions by Pales-
20
tinian minors, written in Hebrew, a language most 
21
could not read, continued to be used as evidence 
22
against them in Israeli military courts’’. 
23
(16) The State Department’s 2016 Annual Re-
24
port noted a ‘‘significant increase in detentions of 
25
01:45 May 02, 2019
H2407
7 
•HR 2407 IH
minors’’ in 2016, and that ‘‘Israeli authorities con-
1
tinued to use confessions signed by Palestinian mi-
2
nors, written in Hebrew’’. It also highlighted the re-
3
newed use of ‘‘administrative detention’’ against Pal-
4
estinians, including children, a practice in which a 
5
detainee may be held indefinitely, without charge or 
6
trial, by the order of a military commander or other 
7
government official. 
8
(17) The nongovernmental organization De-
9
fense for Children International Palestine collected 
10
affidavits from 739 West Bank children who were 
11
detained between 2013 and 2018, and concluded 
12
that— 
13
(A) 73 percent of the children endured 
14
physical violence following arrest; 
15
(B) under Israeli military law, children do 
16
not have the right to a lawyer during interroga-
17
tion; 
18
(C) 96 percent of the children did not have 
19
a parent present during their interrogation; 
20
(D) 74 percent of the children were not 
21
properly informed of their rights by Israeli po-
22
lice; 
23
01:45 May 02, 2019
H2407
8 
•HR 2407 IH
(E) interrogators used stress positions, 
1
threats of violence, and isolation to coerce con-
2
fessions from detained children; 
3
(F) 29 children were detained and placed 
4
in administrative detention, or detention with-
5
out charge or trial, since Israel renewed the 
6
practice against minors in October 2015, and 
7
(G) 122 children were held in pre-trial, 
8
pre-charge isolation for interrogation purposes 
9
for an average period of 13 days. 
10
(18) Amendments to Israeli military law con-
11
cerning the detention of Palestinian children have 
12
had little to no impact on the treatment of children 
13
during the first 24 to 48 hours after an arrest, when 
14
the majority of their ill-treatment occurs. 
15
(19) In 2013, the United Nations Committee 
16
on the Rights of the Child reviewed Israel’s compli-
17
ance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
18
and declared that Palestinian children arrested by 
19
Israeli forces ‘‘continue to be systematically subject 
20
to degrading treatment, and often to acts of torture’’ 
21
and that Israel had ‘‘fully disregarded’’ the previous 
22
recommendations of the Committee to comply with 
23
international law. 
24
01:45 May 02, 2019

•HR 2407 IH
(20) The United Nations Committee Against 
1
Torture, in 2016, reviewed Israel’s compliance with 
2
the Convention Against Torture and reported: ‘‘alle-
3
gations of many instances in which Palestinian mi-
4
nors were exposed to torture or ill-treatment, includ-
5
ing to obtain confessions; were given confessions to 
6
sign in Hebrew, a language they do not understand; 
7
and were interrogated in the absence of a lawyer or 
8
a family member. The Committee is also concerned 
9
that many of these children, like many other Pal-
10
estinians, are deprived of liberty in facilities located 
11
in Israel, thus hindering access to visits of relatives 
12
who live in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.’’. 
13
(21) Existing Federal statutory provisions 
14
known as the ‘‘Leahy law’’ codified at section 620M 
15
of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. 
16
2378d and section 362 of Title 10 of the United 
17
States Code, prohibit the United States Government 
18
from using funds for assistance to units of foreign 
19
security forces where there is credible information 
20
implicating that unit in the commission of gross vio-
21
lations of human rights, including torture. 
22
(22) The United States provides in excess of 
23
$3.8 billion in annual foreign military assistance to 
24
the Government of Israel which enables the military

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
It is the sense of Congress that— 
8
(1) the detention, prosecution, and ill-treatment 
9
of Palestinian children living under military occupa-
10
tion in a military court system that lacks basic and 
11
fundamental guarantees of due process by the Gov-
12
ernment of Israel— 
13
(A) violates international law and inter-
14
nationally recognized standards of human 
15
rights; 
16
(B) is contrary to the values of the Amer-
17
ican people and the efforts of the United States 
18
to support equality, human rights, and dignity 
19
for both Palestinians and Israelis; and 
20
(C) undermines efforts by the United 
21
States and the international community to 
22
achieve a just and lasting peace between Israel 
23
and the Palestinian people; and

(2) Israeli and Palestinian civil society organi-
1
zations working to advance human rights, justice, 
2
and equal treatment for Palestinians living under 
3
Israeli military occupation, as well as Jewish and 
4
non-Jewish citizens of Israel, are essential to pro-
5
moting human dignity, democratic values, and inter-
6
national humanitarian law, and therefore deserve 
7
recognition and support from the United States and 
8
the American people. 
9
SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
10
It is the policy of the United States to promote 
11
human rights for Palestinian children living under Israeli 
12
military occupation and to declare Israel’s system of mili-
13
tary detention of Palestinian children as a practice that 
14
results in widespread and systematic human rights abuses 
15
amounting to gross violations of human rights inconsistent 
16
with international humanitarian law and the laws and val-
17
ues of the United States.
