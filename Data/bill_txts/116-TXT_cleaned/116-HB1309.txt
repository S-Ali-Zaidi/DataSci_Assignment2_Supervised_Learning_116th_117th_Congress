A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Labor to issue an occupational 
safety and health standard that requires covered employ-
ers within the health care and social service industries 
to develop and implement a comprehensive workplace 
violence prevention plan, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Workplace Violence 
2
Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers 
3
Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) In a 2016 report entitled, ‘‘Workplace Safe-
7
ty and Health: Additional Efforts Needed to Help 
8
Protect Health Care Workers from Workplace Vio-
9
lence’’, the Government Accountability Office re-
10
ported over 730,000 cases of health care workplace 
11
assaults over the 5-year span from 2009 through 
12
2013, based on Bureau of Justice Statistics data. 
13
(2) The health care and social service industries 
14
experience the highest rates of injuries caused by 
15
workplace violence. Nurses, social workers, psy-
16
chiatric, home health, and personal care aides are all 
17
at increased risk for injury caused by workplace vio-
18
lence. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 
19
in 2017, rates of violence and injury caused by per-
20
sons in these workplaces ranged from 3 times to as 
21
high as 61.9 times the average American workplace. 
22
(3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 
23
health care and social service workers suffered 69 
24
percent of all workplace violence injuries caused by 
25
persons in 2017 and are nearly 5 times as likely to 
26
23:29 Mar 01, 2019
H1309

•HR 1309 IH
suffer a workplace violence injury than workers over-
1
all. 
2
(4) According to a survey of 3,500 American 
3
emergency physicians conducted by the American 
4
College of Emergency Physicians, 47 percent of 
5
emergency room doctors have been physically as-
6
saulted at work, and 8 in 10 report that this vio-
7
lence is affecting patient care. 
8
(5) Workplace violence in health care and social 
9
service sectors is increasing. Bureau of Labor Statis-
10
tics data show that private sector injury rates of 
11
workplace violence in health care and social service 
12
sectors increased by 63 percent between 2006 and 
13
2016. Due to under-reporting, actual injury rates 
14
from workplace violence are widely recognized to be 
15
higher than reported levels. 
16
(6) Violence in health care settings has adverse 
17
impacts on workers and patients, compromising 
18
quality of care. 
19
(7) Studies have demonstrated that workplace 
20
violence prevention programs tailored to the needs of 
21
specific work areas and State-based workplace vio-
22
lence prevention legislation are strongly associated 
23
with reductions in workplace violence. 
24
23:29 Mar 01, 2019
H1309

•HR 1309 IH
(8) Studies have found that proper staff train-
1
ing, appropriate staffing levels, sufficient resources, 
2
and the use of evidence based interventions (such as 
3
effective communication with patients using de-esca-
4
lation techniques and noncoercive use of medica-
5
tions) can reduce the risks to the safety of both pa-
6
tients and staff, using least-restrictive measures. 
7
(9) The Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
8
ministration has issued ‘‘Guidelines for Preventing 
9
Workplace Violence for Healthcare and Social Serv-
10
ice Workers’’, however, this guidance is not enforce-
11
able. Absent an enforceable standard, employers lack 
12
mandatory requirements to implement an effective 
13
and ongoing violence prevention program that pro-
14
vides protection of workers from workplace violence. 
15
(10) Nine States have mandated that certain 
16
types of health care facilities implement workplace 
17
violence prevention programs. On April 1, 2018, the 
18
Division of Occupational Safety and Health of the 
19
State of California issued a comprehensive standard 
20
(‘‘Workplace Violence Prevention in Health Care’’) 
21
that requires health care facilities to implement a 
22
workplace violence prevention plan. 
23
(11) Employer organizations have challenged 
24
the Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
25
23:29 Mar 01, 2019
H1309

•HR 1309 IH
tion’s authority to utilize the General Duty Clause 
1
of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 
2
to enforce against workplace violence hazards, argu-
3
ing that Congress did not intend to cover workplace 
4
violence under such clause when the Act was enacted 
5
in 1970. 
6
(12) The Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
7
ministration (OSHA) received two petitions for rule-
8
making in July of 2016, calling on OSHA to pro-
9
mulgate a violence prevention standard for health 
10
care and social service sectors. On December 6, 
11
2016, OSHA issued a Request for Information 
12
(RFI) soliciting information on this issue. On Janu-
13
ary 10, 2017, OSHA conducted a public meeting to 
14
receive stakeholder input and to supplement the on-
15
line comments submitted in response to the RFI. At 
16
that meeting, OSHA announced it accepted the peti-
17
tions and would develop a Federal standard to pre-
18
vent workplace violence in health care and social 
19
service settings. OSHA’s efforts to move forward 
20
with rulemaking have been halting, inconsistent, and 
21
slow. Therefore, legislation is necessary to ensure 
22
the timely development of a standard to protect 
23
workers in health care and social service settings.
