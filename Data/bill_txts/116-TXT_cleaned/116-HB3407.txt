SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The Export-Import Bank of the United 
3
States (EXIM)—the official export credit agency of 
4
the United States—is designed to help create and 
5
support U.S. jobs by providing American exporters 
6

H3407

•HR 3407 IH
with the financing tools necessary to compete in the 
1
global markets. 
2
(2) Over its 85-year history, under both Repub-
3
lican and Democratic administrations, the Export- 
4
Import Bank of the United States has been reau-
5
thorized 17 times with large bipartisan majorities in 
6
Congress. 
7
(3) Over the last 10 years, the Export-Import 
8
Bank of the United States has financed more than 
9
$186,000,000,000 in authorizations supporting more 
10
than $255,000,000,000 in United States exports 
11
and supported 1,600,000 United States jobs in all 
12
50 states; in fiscal year 2018, EXIM authorized 
13
$3,300,000,000 in financing and supported an esti-
14
mated 33,000 United States jobs. 
15
(4) By its charter, it is the policy of the United 
16
States that the Export-Import Bank of the United 
17
States should not compete with the private sector, 
18
but rather to fill export financing gaps through its 
19
insurance, loan guarantee, and direct lending pro-
20
grams when the private sector is unable or unwilling 
21
to do so. 
22
(5) With more than 100 export credit agencies 
23
globally, the Export-Import Bank of the United 
24
States, if appropriately utilized, can level the playing 
25

field to ensure that United States companies will not 
1
lose out on a sale of United States exports because 
2
of financing terms offered by foreign governments. 
3
(6) In fiscal year 2018, 90.5 percent of the Ex-
4
port-Import Bank of the United States’ authoriza-
5
tions directly supported small businesses, including 
6
315 small businesses that used the Export-Import 
7
Bank of the United States for the first time. 
8
(7) In fiscal year 2014, when the Export-Im-
9
port Bank of the United States was last fully oper-
10
ational, EXIM authorized $751,000,000 to support 
11
minority- and women-owned business exports. 
12
(8) In fiscal year 2018, the Export-Import 
13
Bank of the United States approved $451,400,000 
14
in support of minority- or woman-owned businesses, 
15
which accounted for 21 percent of total small busi-
16
ness authorizations. 
17
(9) The charter of the Export-Import Bank of 
18
the United States requires the Bank to lend only if 
19
there exists reasonable assurance that it will be re-
20
paid, and Congress subjects EXIM to statutory re-
21
strictions and oversight to safeguard its fiscal sound-
22
ness, limit mismanagement, and prevent corruption. 
23
(10) EXIM was last reauthorized in December 
24
2015, and its charter expires September 30, 2019.

(11) Despite bicameral support for the Bank’s 
1
reauthorization in 2015, the Senate did not confirm 
2
the directors of EXIM until May 2019. As a result, 
3
the Bank did not have a quorum and could not ap-
4
prove transactions over $10,000,000.
