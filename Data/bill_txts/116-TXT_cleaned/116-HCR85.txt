CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the CubeSat Launch Initiative and 
recognizing the launch of WeissSat-1. 
Whereas the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) established the CubeSat Launch Initiative in 
2008 to provide access to space for small satellites 
(‘‘CubeSats’’) developed by the NASA Centers and pro-
grams, educational institutions, and nonprofit organiza-
tions; 
Whereas the CubeSat Launch Initiative gives CubeSat devel-
opers access to a low-cost pathway to conduct research 
in the areas of science, exploration, technology develop-
ment, education, and operations;

Whereas the CubeSat Launch Initiative advances NASA’s 
strategic goals and objectives; 
Whereas CubeSat research is essential for military, edu-
cational, technological, and medical advancements; 
Whereas increased citizen access to space benefits the United 
States, both societally and economically; 
Whereas students, educators, researchers, and companies 
gain knowledge and experience from conducting CubeSat 
missions; 
Whereas the Wolverine CubeSat Development Team at The 
Weiss School, a prekindergarten through 8th grade 
school in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, designed the 
‘‘WeissSat-1’’ that was selected by NASA’s CubeSat 
Launch Initiative in 2017; 
Whereas the ‘‘WeissSat-1’’ was successfully launched Decem-
ber 3, 2018, from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a 
Falcon-9; 
Whereas the Wolverine CubeSat Development Team was se-
lected again by NASA for the CapSat-1 mission in the 
10th Round of the CubeSat Launch Initiative; 
Whereas The Weiss School’s debate team discovered limiting 
factors to broader participation and societal benefit of the 
CubeSat Launch Initiative and brought that research to 
the attention of Congress; 
Whereas the CubeSat Launch Initiative in fiscal year 2019 
received $3,440,000 in contributions from the NASA 
Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, 
Science Mission Directorate, Space Technology Mission 
Directorate, and the Office of Education;

•HCON 85 IH 
Whereas Congress recognizes that NASA reorganized the Of-
fice of Education into the NASA STEM Engagement 
program in order to streamline and maximize the STEM- 
related activities and services it can offer within allocated 
fiscal resources; 
Whereas in NASA’s fiscal year 2020 budget, NASA re-
quested no funding ‘‘for Space Grant, Established Pro-
gram to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and 
Minority Universe Research and Education Project 
(MUREP)’’ and proposed ‘‘to use unobligated balances 
previously appropriated to support the termination of 
these activities, including but not limited to, ongoing ad-
ministration, oversight, monitoring, and funding of 
grants previously awarded by the Office of STEM En-
gagement’’; 
Whereas the Congress passed an appropriations Act, which 
became Public Law 116–93, funding the NASA STEM 
Engagement program at $120,000,000; 
Whereas House Report 116–101 states ‘‘The Committee ex-
pects NASA to continue implementing the programs 
below and to ensure that overhead costs to support these 
programs do not exceed five percent. Further, the Com-
mittee directs NASA to include an adequately requested 
funding amount for STEM in the fiscal year 2021 budget 
request and future requests.’’; 
Whereas Senate Report 116–127 states ‘‘The Committee is 
supportive of NASA’s STEM engagement efforts that 
provide hands-on learning experiences for middle, high 
school, and college students, including space launch ac-
tivities, and therefore rejects the proposed cancellation of 
education programs. These types of programs allow stu-
dents to experience the full range of STEM-related skills

involved in designing, testing, and launching vehicles and 
designing payloads to deepen their interest in science and 
engineering fields.’’; 
Whereas Congress recognizes that it is a critical moment for 
American educators, students, and STEM innovators, 
through their elected Representatives and Senators, to 
identify the critical necessity for NASA’s STEM Engage-
ment programs that must be preserved and expanded; 
Whereas the ultimate validation of this program is when 
CubeSats are launched and operating in space; 
Whereas a limiting factor of getting CubeSats into space is 
lack of program awareness; 
Whereas more awareness leads to the utilization of a low-cost 
pathway to conduct scientific investigations and tech-
nology demonstrations in space; 
Whereas the Wolverine CubeSat Development Team and the 
CubeSat Launch Initiative have shown that younger stu-
dents can be successful in authentic hands-on aerospace 
projects; 
Whereas many students dream of space exploration and have 
interest in STEM careers; and 
Whereas without access to and awareness of available pro-
grams such as the CubeSat Launch Initiative, those 
dreams may be unrealized: Now, therefore, be it

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) as the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
3
ministration continues to streamline its STEM En-
4
gagement program, the CubeSat Launch Initiative 
5
should continue to thrive and expand as a priority 
6
of Congress and an enabler of American innovation; 
7
and 
8
(2) the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
9
istration should prioritize awareness of the CubeSat 
10
Launch Initiative in annual budget proposals.
