10
(1) lead a resolution at the United Nations Se-
11
curity Council or General Assembly and World 
12
Health Assembly outlining the danger to human and 
13
animal health from emerging zoonotic infectious dis-
14
eases, with recommendations for implementing the 
15
worldwide closure of wildlife markets and the ending 
16
of the associated commercial trade of terrestrial 
17
wildlife that feed and supply those markets, except 
18
for in such countries or regions where the consump-
19
tion of wildlife is necessary for local food security or 
20
where such actions would significantly disrupt a 
21
readily available and irreplaceable food supply; 
22
(2) work with governments through existing 
23
treaties and the United Nations to develop a new

protocol or agreement, and amend existing protocols

of wildlife markets as a source of zoonotic diseases 
18
such as the novel coronavirus that causes the disease
