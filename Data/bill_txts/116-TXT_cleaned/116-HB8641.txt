SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) A free and independent press is necessary 
3
for citizens to make informed choices on issues of 
4
public concern, to have the information necessary to 
5
recognize truth from falsehood, and to hold the pow-
6
erful and government officials to account. 
7
(2) As reflected in the First Amendment to the 
8
United States Constitution, a free press is essential 
9
to safeguard democracy. 
10
(3) The suppression of the press is historically 
11
associated with authoritarian rule. 
12
(4) As provided in Article 19 of the United Na-
13
tions Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
14
the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
15
Rights, all people enjoy the right to freedom of opin-
16
ion and expression, which includes the right to seek, 
17
receive, and impart information. 
18
(5) An informed public is fundamental to a free 
19
society. 
20
(6) In accordance with a long United States 
21
history of championing freedom of the press around 
22
the globe, the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press 
23
Act of 2009 was enacted into law (Public Law 111– 
24
166).

•HR 8641 IH
(7) Since the passage of the Daniel Pearl Free-
1
dom of the Press Act of 2009, the global environ-
2
ment for a free and independent press has become 
3
more repressive. 
4
(8) According to 2019 data from the Committee 
5
to Protect Journalists, for the fourth consecutive 
6
year, at least 248 journalists were imprisoned glob-
7
ally in 2019, and in 96 percent of the 337 cases in 
8
which journalists were murdered for their work 
9
worldwide in the preceding decade, either no perpe-
10
trator was successfully prosecuted or only some of 
11
the suspected perpetrators were convicted. 
12
(9) According to 2019 data from Freedom 
13
House, in seven of the last 10 years, more countries 
14
have seen declines in press freedom scores than im-
15
provements. In the last five years, nearly 50 percent 
16
more countries have seen a net decline in press free-
17
dom. 
18
(10) According to 2019 data from Reporters 
19
Without Borders, 63 percent of the journalists killed 
20
last year were deliberately targeted and 59 percent 
21
were killed outside warzones. 
22
(11) In 2018, the brutal murder of Jamal 
23
Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi intelligence officers 
24
acting on explicit orders of the Saudi Government 
25

underscored the extent to which those in power will 
1
go to stifle the freedom of expression, silence their 
2
critics, and eliminate the threat they believe inde-
3
pendent journalists pose to their rule.
