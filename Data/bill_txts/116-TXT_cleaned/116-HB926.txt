•HR 926 IH
(1) Manufactured housing is the largest source 
1
of unsubsidized affordable housing in the country. 
2
(2) Nearly 18,000,000 Americans live in manu-
3
factured housing, which opens the door to homeown-
4
ership for families who, in many housing markets, 
5
cannot afford to buy a site-built home. 
6
(3) A manufactured home qualified under the 
7
Energy Star program established by section 324A of 
8
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 
9
6294a) can save homeowners an average of 24 to 29 
10
percent on total heating and cooling costs, compared 
11
to a typical manufactured home. 
12
(4) Over 40 percent of manufactured homes are 
13
found in land lease communities or ‘‘parks’’, but 
14
new ownership structures, such as resident-owned 
15
cooperatives or communities owned by nonprofits or 
16
public housing authorities, can provide homeowners 
17
greater land tenure security and stability that en-
18
hances the value of their homes. 
19
(5) These advances position manufactured 
20
homes to appreciate in value and open the door to 
21
homeownership for millions of families, and have 
22
proven to be an effective long-term affordable hous-
23
ing preservation strategy for communities across the 
24
United States.
