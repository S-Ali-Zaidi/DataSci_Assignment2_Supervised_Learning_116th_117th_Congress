•HR 8784 IH
(1) Eighty-five to 90 percent of a wind turbine 
1
is recyclable, and is done so economically. However, 
2
some pieces of the turbine, notably the blade, do not 
3
have economical recycling options in the United 
4
States. 
5
(2) These blades are often made out of either 
6
glass or carbon fiber and held together with a series 
7
of resins and polymers. 
8
(3) These blades are built to last for decades 
9
and withstand the harshest conditions, making their 
10
strength their weakness for recyclability. 
11
(4) Currently, these blades are landfilled at a 
12
low cost and because they are an inert product, can 
13
safely be stored for long periods of time without con-
14
taminating local soil or aquifers. 
15
(5) These blades often have useful life left and 
16
can be used on a new turbine, potentially lowering 
17
costs on other projects or enabling projects that may 
18
not otherwise have been carried out.
