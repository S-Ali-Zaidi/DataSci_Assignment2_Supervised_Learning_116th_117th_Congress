(5) In section 4201 of the Fiscal Year 2018 
15
National Defense Authorization Act, Congress reit-
16
erated the importance of prioritizing this relation-
17
ship by authorizing more than $12,000,000 above 
18
the President’s requests, including 2,000,000 au-
19
thorized specifically for minority women in the fields 
20
of science, technology, engineering, and mathe-
21
matics.

study related to STEAM, they continue to be under-
1
represented in the STEAM fields.

(7) While underrepresented minority students 
3
overall face an opportunity gap in STEAM edu-
4
cation, women of color face a larger achievement gap 
5
in science and engineering education.

(8) In 2016, of bachelor’s degrees awarded in 
7
STEAM majors— 
8
(A) women received 36 percent;

matics, and statistics, and engineering received by 
20
women of color has declined since 1996.
