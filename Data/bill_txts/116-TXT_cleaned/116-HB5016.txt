SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On May 9, 2013, President Barack Obama 
3
issued an Executive order that made open and ma-
4
chine-readable data the new default for government 
5
information. 
6
(2) Open data principles are essential for trans-
7
parency and efficiency in government. 
8
(3) In 2012, the Federal Communications Com-
9
mission required television broadcast stations to 
10
place on the internet website of the Commission cer-
11
tain materials in the files such stations are required 
12
to maintain and make available for public inspection, 
13
including important information about the pur-
14
chasing of political advertisements. In 2016, the 
15
Commission extended the online public inspection 
16
file requirement to providers of cable and satellite 
17
television service, radio broadcast stations, and pro-
18
viders of satellite radio service. 
19
(4) The Commission declined to require such 
20
materials to be machine-readable, deciding at the 
21
time that it was more important to get the informa-
22
tion online faster. 
23
(5) Machine readability is a critical component 
24
of open government and provides interested parties
