15
nologies to prevent plastics and composites, includ-
16
ing waterborne plastics, from entering landfills and 
17
the marine environment; 
18
(2) develop biological, chemical, and hybrid bio- 
19
chemical technologies and methods for deconstruct-
20
ing plastic and composite waste, including environ-
21
mental waste, into useful chemical and material 
22
streams;

1
cluding chemical, material, and gaseous streams, 
2
into higher-value products; 
3
(4) develop new economically recyclable-by-de-
4
sign plastics and composites that can be scaled for 
5
domestic manufacturability and recovery; 
6
(5) develop new energy-efficient advanced man-
7
ufacturing techniques for reclaimed plastics and 
8
composites; and 
9
(6) develop new data collection methods and 
10
practices in collaboration with relevant Federal 
11
agencies. 
12
(c) LEVERAGING.—In carrying out the program 
13
under this section, the Secretary shall leverage resources 
14
and expertise from— 
15
