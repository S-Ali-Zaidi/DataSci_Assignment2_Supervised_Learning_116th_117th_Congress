Whereas the United Nations held its second International 
Conference on Population in Mexico City between August 
6 and August 14, 1984; 
Whereas the primary purpose of this conference was to dis-
cuss the implications of population growth in the devel-
oping world and to build on the findings of the first con-
ference on this topic, which met in Bucharest, Romania, 
10 years before; 
Whereas the United States was 1 of 147 member states of 
the United Nations that agreed to participate in the con-
ference; 
Whereas President Ronald Reagan, in a May 30, 1984, pre- 
conference message to Mexican President Miguel de la 
Madrid Hurtado, expressed the belief that the challenges 
posed by significant population growth in many devel-
oping nations could and should be met in such a way as 
to ‘‘respect and enhance the freedom of the individual’’; 
Whereas President Reagan’s May 30, 1984, message contin-
ued: ‘‘We believe population programs can and must be 
truly voluntary, cognizant of the rights and responsibil-
ities of individuals and families, and respectful of reli-
gious and cultural values. When they are, such programs 
can make an important contribution to economic and so-
cial development, to the health of mothers and children, 
and to the stability of the family and of society’’; 
Whereas President Reagan’s May 30, 1984, message cul-
minated with the following statement: ‘‘Our concern over 
the dimensions of demographic change is inseparable 
from a concern for the welfare of children—who are the 
ultimate resource of any society.’’;

Whereas President Reagan selected then-former Undersecre-
tary of State James L. Buckley to attend the Inter-
national Conference on Population in Mexico City; 
Whereas Ambassador Buckley addressed a plenary session of 
the conference on August 8, 1984; 
Whereas Ambassador Buckley stated in this address that 
‘‘the United States does not consider abortion an accept-
able element of family planning program’’; 
Whereas Ambassador Buckley’s statement clarified United 
States policy along the following lines: 
(1) ‘‘First, where United States funds are contrib-
uted to nations which support abortion with other funds, 
the United States will contribute to such nations through 
segregated accounts which cannot be used for abortion.’’; 
(2) ‘‘Second, the United States will no longer con-
tribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which 
perform or actively promote abortion as a method of fam-
ily planning in other nations.’’; and 
(3) ‘‘Third, before the United States will contribute 
funds to the UN Fund for Population Activities it will in-
sist that no part of its contribution be used for abortion 
and will also first require concrete assurances that the 
UNFPA is not engaged in, and does not provide funding 
for, abortion or coercive family planning programs. 
Should such assurances not be possible, and in order to 
maintain the level of its overall contribution to the inter-
national effort, the United States will redirect the 
amount of its intended contribution to other, non- 
UNFPA family planning programs.’’; 
Whereas these proscriptions have come to be known as the 
‘‘Mexico City policy’’;
