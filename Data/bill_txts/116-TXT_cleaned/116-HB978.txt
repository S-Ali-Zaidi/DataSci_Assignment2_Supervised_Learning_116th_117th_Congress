tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In 2009, the Environmental Protection 
3
Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transpor-
4
tation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis-
5
tration (NHTSA) reached an historic agreement 
6
with State regulators, automakers, the United Auto 
7
Workers, and leaders in the environmental commu-
8
nity to establish One National Program for Federal 
9
standards to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
10
sions and increase corporate average fuel economy 
11
(CAFE´) for light duty vehicles, in cooperation and 
12
alignment with the California Air Resources Board 
13
(CARB). 
14
(2) In 2012, as part of One National Program, 
15
EPA established final GHG emission standards for 
16
model years 2017 through 2025 and NHTSA estab-
17
lished final CAFE´ standards for model years 2017 
18
through 2021 and augural standards for model 
19
years 2022 through 2025. 
20
(3) The agencies’ standards are based on the 
21
specific footprint of vehicles to provide automotive 
22
manufacturers flexibility and ensure that consumers 
23
have a choice of a full range of vehicle sizes to meet 
24
their needs. Under the footprint-based system, small

vehicles must meet more stringent standards than 
1
large vehicles. 
2
(4) A midterm evaluation of the standards for 
3
model years 2022 through 2025 concluded that they 
4
remain feasible for industry, with multiple pathways 
5
for compliance, and are appropriate for achieving 
6
the goals of cutting GHG emissions and increasing 
7
fuel economy. 
8
(5) In January 2017, EPA issued a final deter-
9
mination to maintain the existing GHG emissions 
10
standards for model years 2022 through 2025 as 
11
prescribed by the 2012 final rule. NHTSA is cur-
12
rently assessing the augural CAFE´ standards pro-
13
posed for model years 2022 through 2025 and will 
14
conduct a rulemaking to prescribe final standards 
15
for those years. 
16
(6) The final GHG emission standards and 
17
augural CAFE´
standards for model years 2022 
18
through 2025 are projected to achieve an average 
19
overall fleet-wide emissions target of 173 grams CO2 
20
per mile and an average overall fleet-wide fuel econ-
21
omy target of 46.3 miles per gallon by the year 
22
2025, resulting in a 540 million metric ton reduction 
23
in greenhouse gases and a 1.2 billion barrel reduc-

tion in oil consumption over the lifetime of these ve-
1
hicles. 
2
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
3
gress that maintaining the GHG and CAFE´ standards at 
4
their current levels through model year 2025— 
5
(1) is essential to achieving the projected fleet 
6
wide average goals of 173 grams CO2 per mile and 
7
46.3 miles per gallon; and 
8
(2) will result in substantial benefits for Amer-
9
ican drivers, the environment, public health, and en-
10
ergy security.
