A BILL 
To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to allow 
all eligible voters to vote by mail in Federal elections. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Universal Right to 
4
Vote by Mail Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the 
8
United States because voters in some States have

•HR 138 IH
the universal right to vote by mail while voters in 
1
other States do not. 
2
(2) Many voters often have work, family, or 
3
other commitments that make getting to polls on the 
4
date of an election difficult or impossible. Under 
5
current State laws, many of these voters are not per-
6
mitted to vote by mail. 
7
(3) 32 States and the District of Columbia cur-
8
rently allow universal absentee voting (also known as 
9
‘‘no-excuse’’ absentee voting), which permits any 
10
voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a 
11
reason for the request, and no State which has im-
12
plemented no-excuse absentee voting has switched 
13
back. 
14
(4) Voting by mail gives voters more time to 
15
consider their choices, which is especially important 
16
as many ballots contain greater numbers of ques-
17
tions about complex issues than in the past due to 
18
the expanded use of the initiative and referendum 
19
process in many States. 
20
(5) Allowing all voters the option to vote by 
21
mail can lead to increased voter participation. 
22
(6) Allowing all voters the option to vote by 
23
mail can reduce waiting times for those voters who 
24
choose to vote at the polls.

(7) Voting by mail is preferable to many voters 
1
as an alternative to going to the polls. Voting by 
2
mail has become increasingly popular with voters 
3
who want to be certain that they are able to vote no 
4
matter what comes up on Election Day. 
5
(8) No evidence exists suggesting the potential 
6
for fraud in absentee balloting is greater than the 
7
potential for fraud by any other method of voting. 
8
(9) Many of the reasons which voters in many 
9
States are required to provide in order to vote by 
10
mail require the revelation of personal information 
11
about health, travel plans, or religious activities, 
12
which violate voters’ privacy while doing nothing to 
13
prevent voter fraud. 
14
(10) State laws which require voters to obtain 
15
a notary signature to vote by mail only add cost and 
16
inconvenience to voters without increasing security.
