A BILL 
To require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
to collect and report certain data concerning COVID–19. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equitable Data Collec-
4
tion and Disclosure on COVID–19 Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) de-
8
clared COVID–19 a ‘‘Public Health Emergency of 
9
International Concern’’ on January 30, 2020. By 
10
late March 2020, there have been over 470,000 con-
11
firmed cases of, and 20,000 deaths associated with, 
12
COVID–19 worldwide. 
13
(2) In the United States, cases of COVID–19 
14
have quickly surpassed those across the world, and 
15
as of April 12, 2020, over 500,000 cases and 20,000 
16
deaths have been reported in the United States 
17
alone. 
18
(3) Early reporting on racial inequities in 
19
COVID–19 testing and treatment have renewed calls 
20
for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
21
and other relevant subagencies within the Depart-

ment of Health and Human Services to publicly re-
1
lease racial and demographic information to better 
2
inform the pandemic response, specifically in com-
3
munities of color and in Limited English Proficient 
4
(LEP) communities. 
5
(4) The burden of morbidity and mortality in 
6
the United States has historically fallen dispropor-
7
tionately on marginalized communities (those who 
8
suffer the most from great public health needs and 
9
are the most medically underserved). 
10
(5) Historically, structures and systems, such 
11
as racism, ableism and class oppression, have ren-
12
dered affected individuals more vulnerable to inequi-
13
ties and have prevented people from achieving their 
14
optimal health even when there is not a crisis of 
15
pandemic proportions. 
16
(6) Significant differences in access to health 
17
care, specifically to primary health care providers, 
18
health care information, and greater perceived dis-
19
crimination in health care place communities of 
20
color, individuals with disabilities, and LEP individ-
21
uals at greater risk of receiving delayed, and per-
22
haps poorer, health care. 
23
(7) Stark racial inequities across the United 
24
States, including unequal access to stable housing, 
25

•HR 6585 IH
quality education, and decent employment signifi-
1
cantly impact the ability of individuals to take care 
2
of their most basic health needs. Communities of 
3
color are more likely to experience homelessness and 
4
struggle with low-paying jobs or unemployment. To 
5
date, experts have cited that 2 in 5 Latino residents 
6
in New York City, the current epicenter of the 
7
COVID–19 pandemic, are recently unemployed as a 
8
direct consequence of COVID–19. And at a time 
9
when sheltering in place will save lives, less than 1 
10
in 5 Black workers and roughly 1 in 6 Latino work-
11
ers are able to work from home. 
12
(8) Communities of color experience higher 
13
rates of chronic disease and disabilities, such as dia-
14
betes, hypertension, and asthma, than non-Hispanic 
15
White communities, which predisposes them to 
16
greater risk of complications and mortality should 
17
they contract COVID–19. 
18
(9) Such communities are made even more vul-
19
nerable to the uncertainty of the preparation, re-
20
sponse, and events surrounding the pandemic public 
21
health crisis, COVID–19. For instance, in the recent 
22
past, multiple epidemiologic studies and reviews have 
23
reported higher rates of hospitalization due to the 
24
2009 H1N1 pandemic among the poor, individuals 
25

•HR 6585 IH
with disabilities and preexisting conditions, those liv-
1
ing in impoverished neighborhoods, and individuals 
2
of color and ethnic backgrounds in the United 
3
States. These findings highlight the urgency to 
4
adapt the COVID–19 response to monitor and act 
5
on these inequities via data collection and research 
6
by race and ethnicity. 
7
(10) Research experts recognize that there are 
8
underlying differences in illness and death when 
9
each of these factors are examined through socio-
10
economic and racial or ethnic lenses. These socially 
11
determinant factors of health accelerate disease and 
12
degradation. 
13
(11) Language barriers are highly correlated 
14
with medication noncompliance and inconsistent en-
15
gagement with health systems. Without language ac-
16
cessibility data and research around COVID–19, 
17
these communities are less likely to receive critical 
18
testing and preventive health services. Yet, to date, 
19
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do 
20
not disseminate COVID–19 messaging in critical 
21
languages, including Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, 
22
and Korean within the same timeframe as informa-
23
tion in English despite requirements to ensure lim-
24
ited English proficient populations are not discrimi-

nated against under title VI of the Civil Rights Act 
1
of 1964 and subsequent laws and Federal policies. 
2
(12) Further, it is critical to disaggregate data 
3
further by ancestry to address disparities among 
4
Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Is-
5
lander groups. According to the National Equity 
6
Atlas, while 13 percent of the Asian population over-
7
all lived in poverty in 2015, 39 percent of Burmese 
8
people, 29 percent of Hmong people, and 21 percent 
9
of Pacific Islanders lived in poverty. 
10
(13) Utilizing disaggregation of enrollment in 
11
Affordable Care Act-sponsored health insurance, the 
12
Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum 
13
found that prior to the passage of the Patient Pro-
14
tection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111– 
15
148), Korean Americans had a high uninsured rate 
16
of 23 percent, compared to just 12 percent for all 
17
Asian Americans. Developing targeted outreach ef-
18
forts assisted 1,000,000 people and resulted in a 56- 
19
percent decrease in the uninsured among the Asian, 
20
Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander population. 
21
Such efforts show that disaggregated data is essen-
22
tial to public health mobilizations efforts. 
23
(14) Without clear understanding of how 
24
COVID–19 impacts marginalized racial and ethnic 
25
00:11 Apr 25, 2020
H6585

•HR 6585 IH
communities, there will be exacerbated risk of en-
1
dangering the most historically vulnerable of our 
2
Nation. 
3
(15) The consequences of misunderstanding the 
4
racial and ethnic impact of COVID–19 expound be-
5
yond communities of color such that it would impact 
6
all. 
7
(16) Race and ethnicity are valuable research 
8
and practice variables when used and interpreted ap-
9
propriately. Health data collected on patients by 
10
race and ethnicity will boost and more efficiently di-
11
rect critical resources and inform risk communica-
12
tion development in languages and at appropriate 
13
health literacy levels, which resonate with historically 
14
vulnerable communities of color. 
15
(17) To date, there is no public standardized 
16
and comprehensive race and ethnicity data reposi-
17
tory of COVID–19 testing, hospitalizations, or mor-
18
tality. The inconsistency of data collection by Fed-
19
eral, State, and local health authorities, and the in-
20
ability to access data by public research institutions 
21
and academic organizations, poses a threat to anal-
22
ysis and synthesis of the pandemic impact on com-
23
munities of color. However, research and medical ex-
24

academic health care institutions which are histori-
1
cally and geographically embedded in minoritized 
2
and marginalized communities, generally also pos-
3
sess rapport with the communities they serve. They 
4
are well-positioned, as trusted thought leaders and 
5
health care service providers, to collect data and con-
6
duct research toward creating holistic solutions to 
7
remedy the inequitable impact of this and future 
8
public health crises. 
9
(18) Well-designed, ethically sound research 
10
aligns with the goals of medicine, addresses ques-
11
tions relevant to the population among whom the 
12
study will be carried out, balances the potential for 
13
benefit against the potential for harm, employs 
14
study designs that will yield scientifically valid and 
15
significant data, and generates useful knowledge. 
16
(19) The dearth of racially and ethnically 
17
disaggregated data reflecting the health of commu-
18
nities of color underlies the challenges of a fully in-
19
formed public health response. 
20
(20) Without collecting race and ethnicity data 
21
associated with COVID–19 testing, hospitalizations, 
22
morbidities, and mortalities, as well as publicly dis-
23
closing it, communities of color will remain at great-
24
er risk of disease and death.
