5
of the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enact-
6
ment of this Act and not less often than every 2 years 
7
thereafter, conduct a study under this section that— 
8
(1) identifies non-driving related underwriting 
9
factors used by private passenger automobile insur-
10
ers and the extent to which each such underwriting 
11
factor impacts the final rate for an insured and an 
12
insured’s placement in an insurer’s various compa-
13
nies and rating tiers; 
14
(2) identifies existing controls and current auto-
15
mobile insurer practices to prevent discriminatory 
16
pricing of automobile insurance coverage, including 
17
any controls to identify and prevent discrimination 
18
through the use of pricing algorithms; 
19
(3) evaluates the presence or absence of dis-
20
parate impact in private passenger automobile insur-
21
ance premiums, risk classifications, and an insurer’s 
22
company or tier placement based on non-driving re-
23
lated factors, including examining how such pre-
24
miums are impacted by factors such as zip code,

ographic area, gender, marital status, occupation,

occupation status, level of education, consumer cred-

it score and history, and homeownership status;

(4) assesses the extent to which States consist-
4
ently determine what is unfairly discriminatory in 
5
private passenger automobile insurance pricing, risk 
6
classifications, and product offerings and what 
7
standards are used by State insurance regulators to 
8
make such a determination for oversight and en-
9
forcement purposes; 
10
(5) determines the manner and frequency with 
11
which State insurance regulators identify question-
12
able underwriting and rating practices in the provi-
13
sion of private passenger automobile insurance cov-
14
erage and take actions to address findings of non-
15
compliance with State law and ensure that rates are 
16
not excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory, 
17
including analyzing any problems and deficiencies 
18
identified among State insurance regulators.

(2) evaluates the use of data related to non- 
6
driving characteristics in underwriting and pricing 
7
assistance and premium calculations; and 
8
(3) determines the extent to which any of the 
9
research indicates a disparate impact on protected 
10
classes of people resulting from the use of non-driv-
11
ing rating and underwriting factors.
