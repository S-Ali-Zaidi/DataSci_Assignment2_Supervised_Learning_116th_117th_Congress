Whereas the essential role of the independent press and jour-
nalists in a free and democratic society has been recog-
nized since the colonial period of the United States and 
is enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Constitution proclaims: 
‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment 
of religion, or preventing the free exercise thereof; or 
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the 
right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition 
the government for a redress of grievances.’’; 
Whereas Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declara-
tion of Human Rights, adopted at Paris, December 10, 
1948, states, ‘‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opin-
ion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold 
opinions without interference and to seek, receive and im-
part information and ideas through any media and re-
gardless of frontiers.’’; 
Whereas the United States has made promotion of press free-
dom worldwide a core part of its human rights and de-
mocracy promotion efforts; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has accelerated the decline 
of local news, documented by PEN America in the report 
Losing the News, shuttering critical information re-
sources, 
particularly 
for 
rural 
populations 
and 
marginalized communities; 
Whereas journalists have a long established and recognized 
right to report, and actions by law enforcement or other 
authorities that prevent them from doing so through in-
timidation, violence, arrest, or detention is an affront to 
the First Amendment;

cials accountable’’; 
Whereas, as of June 4, 2020, the U.S. Press Freedom Track-
er, a nonpartisan website managed by the Freedom of the 
Press Foundation, has received reports of more than 300

journalists covering the demonstrations nationwide; 
Whereas these cases include instances of journalists and 
media workers being specifically targeted by law enforce-
ment with tear gas, pepper spray or pepper balls, or rub-
ber bullets despite displaying press credentials and identi-
fying themselves as members of the press;

ber bullet at the face of a freelance writer and photog-

Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, and a Wilmington News-

themselves as press; 
Whereas some cities and States have imposed curfews in a 
bid to contain the demonstrations, some of which have 
turned violent, but not all of the curfew orders have ex-
plicitly exempted members of the press; 
Whereas journalists have a vital role to play in documenting 
and reporting on the protests and must be able to freely 
cover these events without fear of retaliation from au-
thorities; and 
Whereas freedom of the press—
