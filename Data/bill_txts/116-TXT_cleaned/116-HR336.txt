(5) a guest house near the National Zoo of Sri 
Lanka; and 
(6) a housing complex in Dematagoda, Sri Lanka; 
Whereas more than 250 people were killed and more than 
500 people were injured in the attacks; 
Whereas the attackers acted in the name of National 
Thowheeth Jama’ath (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘NTJ’’), a local Islamist group that had previously at-
tacked Buddhist monks and statues; 
Whereas NTJ has ties to global Islamist terrorist organiza-
tions and subscribes to an intolerant Wahhabi ideology 
that condones violence against non-Muslims and fellow 
Muslims; and 
Whereas the Wall Street Journal has reported that, according 
to SITE, a terrorist-monitoring firm, on Tuesday, April 
23, 2019, the Islamic State released a video claiming re-
sponsibility for the attacks, stating that ‘‘the executors of 
the attack that targeted citizens of coalition states and 
Christians in Sri Lanka two days ago were Islamic State 
fighters’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the April 21, 2019, terrorist at-
2
tacks in Sri Lanka as— 
3
(A) targeted principally against Christians 
4
because of their faith, on their holy day of 
5
Easter, during their Easter prayers; and 
6
(B) perpetrated by radical Islamist terror-
7
ists acting in the name of a hateful radical 
8
Islamist ideology;
