SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Long Island has played an indispensable 
3
role in the development of the aviation industry in 
4
the United States. In particular, the Hempstead 
5
Plains, Suffolk County Air Force Base, and parts of 
6
Bethpage, Port Washington, and Farmingdale con-
7
tain notable landmarks of aviation history. 
8
(2) The Hempstead Plains encompass approxi-
9
mately 950 acres east of Clinton Road and south of 
10
Old Country Road in Garden City, New York, and 
11
have been called the ‘‘Cradle of Aviation’’. 
12
(3) In the early 20th century, the Hempstead 
13
Plains had 3 major airfields, all of great historical 
14
significance: Roosevelt Field, Curtiss Field, and 
15
Mitchel Field. 
16
(4) During World War I, the airfields of Hemp-
17
stead Plains were an important training center for 
18
United States military pilots, as well as a major hub 
19
for military aircraft research, development, and pro-
20
duction. 
21
(5) The first transatlantic flight, carried out by 
22
the U.S. Navy Curtiss NC–4 in 1919, took off from 
23
Rockaway, New York, and cemented the United 
24
States leading role in aviation innovation. This air-

craft was built at the Curtiss factory in Garden 
1
City—a building which still stands. 
2
(6) Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York, 
3
was the point of departure for Charles Lindbergh’s 
4
famous transatlantic flight aboard the Spirit of St. 
5
Louis completed on May 20, 1927. 
6
(7) In 1929, Amelia Earhart and other pio-
7
neering women pilots founded the International Or-
8
ganization of Women Pilots, or the Ninety-Nines, at 
9
Curtiss Field. 
10
(8) Curtiss Field also served as the terminus 
11
for transcontinental airmail from 1918–1929. 
12
(9) In the 1930s, Roosevelt Field was the busi-
13
est civilian airfield in the United States, and played 
14
a role in many other historic transcontinental, trans-
15
atlantic, and record-setting flights. 
16
(10) Port Washington, New York, once known 
17
as the ‘‘Plymouth Rock’’ of American aviation, was 
18
Pan American World Airways’ trans-Atlantic hub on 
19
Manhasset Isle from 1934 to 1940. 
20
(11) During World War II, Long Island was a 
21
crucial center of military aircraft production. These 
22
aircraft, produced in huge numbers for the Army, 
23
Navy, and foreign governments, were of excellent

quality and had a major impact on the course of the 
1
war in all theaters. 
2
(12) Most notably, the Grumman Aircraft Com-
3
pany, based in Bethpage, New York, and the Repub-
4
lic Aviation Corporation, based in Farmingdale, New 
5
York, manufactured innovative planes that proved 
6
highly valuable to the U.S. military such as Grum-
7
man’s F6F–3 Hellcat and Republic’s P–47 Thun-
8
derbolt. 
9
(13) Mitchel Air Force Base, located on the 
10
Hempstead Plains, served as the original location of 
11
the Air Defense Command upon its inception in 
12
1940, and was integral to the defense of the main-
13
land United States during World War II and there-
14
after. 
15
(14) In 1951, the Suffolk County Air Force 
16
Base, located in Westhampton, New York, became 
17
the prime Air Defense Command base responsible 
18
for defending the New York City metropolitan area 
19
from all air attacks. 
20
(15) In 1962, Grumman won the contract to 
21
build the Lunar Module as part of the Apollo Pro-
22
gram, and in 1969 the first men traveled to the 
23
moon aboard a spacecraft built with the expertise of 
24
Long Island’s aviation industry.
