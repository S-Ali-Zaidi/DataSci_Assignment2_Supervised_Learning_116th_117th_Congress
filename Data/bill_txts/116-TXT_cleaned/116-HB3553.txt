‘‘(A) Firearms tracing is the systematic track-
1
ing of the movement of a firearm recovered by law 
2
enforcement officials from the first sale of a firearm 
3
by the manufacturer or importer through the dis-
4
tribution chain (including the wholesaler and re-
5
tailer) to the first retail purchaser. 
6
‘‘(B) Law enforcement agencies across the 
7
country work with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
8
Firearms, and Explosives to trace firearms and 
9
thereby obtain investigative leads in the fight 
10
against violent crime and terrorism. 
11
‘‘(C) The ability of law enforcement agencies to 
12
trace a firearm is dependent on the serial number or 
13
other marks on the firearm that identify the manu-
14
facturer or importer who manufactured or imported 
15
the firearm and that are unique to the firearm.

‘‘(D) Interstate gun trafficking interferes with

21

a State other than the State where the firearms

were recovered. These guns made up 28.8 percent of

5
may be constructed and transported freely from
