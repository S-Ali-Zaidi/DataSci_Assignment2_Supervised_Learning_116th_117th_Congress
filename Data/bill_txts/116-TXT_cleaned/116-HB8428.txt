SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Hong Kong National Security Law pro-
3
mulgated on July 1, 2020— 
4
(A) contravenes the Basic Law of the 
5
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (re-
6
ferred to in this Act as ‘‘the Basic Law’’) that 
7
provides in Article 23 that the Legislative 
8
Council of Hong Kong shall enact legislation re-
9
lated to national security; 
10
(B) violates the PRC’s commitments under 
11
international law, as defined by the Joint Dec-
12
laration; and 
13
(C) causes severe and irreparable damage 
14
to the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ principle and 
15
further erodes global confidence in the PRC’s 
16
commitment to international law. 
17
(2) On July 14, 2020, in response to the pro-
18
mulgation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, 
19
President Trump signed an Executive order on 
20
Hong Kong normalization that, among other policy 
21
actions, suspended the special treatment of Hong 
22
Kong persons under U.S. law with respect to the 
23
issuance of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. 
24
(3) The United States has a long and proud 
25
history as a destination for refugees and asylees flee-
26

ing persecution based on race, religion, nationality, 
1
political opinion, or membership in a particular so-
2
cial group. 
3
(4) The United States also shares deep social, 
4
cultural, and economic ties with the people of Hong 
5
Kong, including a shared commitment to democracy, 
6
to the rule of law, and to the protection of human 
7
rights. 
8
(5) The United States has sheltered, protected, 
9
and welcomed individuals who have fled authori-
10
tarian regimes, including citizens from the PRC fol-
11
lowing the violent June 4, 1989, crackdown in 
12
Tiananmen Square, deepening ties between the peo-
13
ple of the United States and those individuals seek-
14
ing to contribute to a free, open society founded on 
15
democracy, human rights, and the respect for the 
16
rule of law. 
17
(6) The United States has reaped enormous 
18
economic, cultural, and strategic benefits from wel-
19
coming successive generations of scientists, doctors, 
20
entrepreneurs, artists, intellectuals, and other free-
21
dom-loving people fleeing fascism, communism, vio-
22
lent Islamist extremism, and other repressive 
23
ideologies, including in the cases of Nazi Germany,

the Soviet Union, and Soviet-controlled Central Eu-
1
rope, Cuba, Vietnam, and Iran. 
2
(7) A major asymmetric advantage of the 
3
United States in its long-term strategic competition 
4
with the Communist Party of China is the ability of 
5
people from every country in the world, irrespective 
6
of their race, ethnicity, or religion, to immigrate to 
7
the United States and become American citizens.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
9
It is the policy of the United States— 
10
(1) to reaffirm the principles and objectives set 
11
forth in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 
12
1992 (Public Law 102–383), namely that— 
13
(A) the United States has ‘‘a strong inter-
14
est in the continued vitality, prosperity, and 
15
stability of Hong Kong’’; 
16
(B) ‘‘support for democratization is a fun-
17
damental principle of United States foreign pol-
18
icy’’ and therefore ‘‘naturally applies to United 
19
States policy toward Hong Kong’’; 
20
(C) ‘‘the human rights of the people of 
21
Hong Kong are of great importance to the 
22
United States and are directly relevant to 
23
United States interests in Hong Kong and

serve as a basis for Hong Kong’s continued eco-
1
nomic prosperity’’; and 
2
(D) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently 
3
autonomous from the PRC to ‘‘justify treat-
4
ment under a particular law of the United 
5
States, or any provision thereof, different from 
6
that accorded the People’s Republic of China’’; 
7
(2) to continue to support the high degree of 
8
autonomy and fundamental rights and freedoms of 
9
the people of Hong Kong, as enumerated by—

(A) the Joint Declaration; 
11
(B) the International Covenant on Civil

Rights, done at Paris December 10, 1948;

17

18
‘‘ultimate aim’’ of the selection of the Chief Execu-
19
tive and all members of the Legislative Council by 
20
universal suffrage, as articulated in the Basic Law; 
21
(4) to urge the Government of the PRC, despite 
22
its recent actions, to uphold its commitments to 
23
Hong Kong, including allowing the people of Hong

Kong to govern Hong Kong with a high degree of

suring that Hong Kong voters freely enjoy the right

democratic option to freely and fairly nominate and

elect the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, and the es-
8
tablishment of open and direct democratic elections 
9
for all members of the Hong Kong Legislative Coun-

cil;

(6) to support the robust exercise by residents 
12
of Hong Kong of the rights to free speech, the press, 
13
and other fundamental freedoms, as provided by the 
14
Basic Law, the Joint Declaration, and the Inter-
15

(10) to maintain the economic and cultural ties

10
of the Fulbright exchange program with regard to 
11
Hong Kong at the earliest opportunity;
