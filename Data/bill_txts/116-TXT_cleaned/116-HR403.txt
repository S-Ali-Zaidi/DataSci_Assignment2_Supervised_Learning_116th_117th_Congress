Pitt with the United States in 1778 to provide Native 
troops and grant Americans permission to stage attacks

Whereas the United States World War II mobilization efforts

and doctors on reservations as medical professionals 
joined military operations;

dian land for the establishment of Japanese internment 
camps on the Gila and Colorado River Indian Reserva-
tions (Mohave and Chemehuevi) in Arizona occurred

United States military, and was extolled by her surviving 
servicemembers as the heroine of the ambush in which 
she died;

Whereas Native American veterans experience higher rates of 
homelessness and substance abuse than other groups, 
and face limited access to medical care due to the short-

Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

service, sacrifice, and patriotism of Native American

veterans; 
4
(2) recognizes the indispensable contributions of 
5
Native Americans in advancing United States inter-
6
ests, military successes, and global stability, often as 
7
the United States Government failed to fulfill its

Federal trust responsibility and protect Tribal treaty

rights, lands, and resources; and 
10
(3) commits to addressing the unique hardships 
11
and inequities faced by Native veterans, servicemem-

bers, and Gold Star families as well as upholding
