To galvanize United States Government programs in support 
of brain health for global victims of autism, hydro-
cephalus and Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The brain is the center of the human nerv-
3
ous system, exerting centralized control over all 
4
other organs of the body. 
5
(2) Abnormalities in sections of the brain— 
6
namely the corpus callosum (which facilitates com-
7
munication between the two hemispheres of the 
8
brain), the amygdala (which affects emotion and so-
9
cial behavior), and the cerebellum (which is involved 
10
with motor activity, balance, and coordination)— 
11
usually occur during prenatal development. 
12
(3) Three main brain disorders are autism, hy-
13
drocephalus and Alzheimer’s and other forms of de-
14
mentia. They impact people in both the developed 
15
and developing world, but weigh more heavily on 
16
sufferers in developing countries due to lack of effec-
17
tive health care, lack of access to health care, or cul-
18
tural influences that inhibit treatment of sufferers of 
19
one of these conditions. 
20
(4) Autism is a complex neurological disorder 
21
that affects an individual in the areas of social inter-
22
action and communication. Because it is a spectrum 
23
disorder, it affects each individual differently and to 
24
varying degrees of severity. People with autism proc-
25
ess and respond to information in unique ways. In 
26

•HR 2077 IH
some cases, coexisting medical issues and aggressive 
1
or self-injurious behavior may be present. 
2
(5) The occurrence of autism spectrum dis-
3
orders (ASD) has increased during the past decade 
4
from an estimated one in 150 in 2000 to an esti-
5
mated one in 68 in 2012, according to data released 
6
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
7
(CDC) in December 2016. CDC classified as suf-
8
fering from ASD children whose behaviors were con-
9
sistent with the DSM–IV–TR criteria for Autistic 
10
Disorder, Asperger Disorder, and Pervasive Develop-
11
mental Disorder—Not Otherwise Specified (PDD– 
12
NOS). 
13
(6) The increased number of children diagnosed 
14
with autism is a growing and urgent concern for 
15
families, healthcare professionals, and educators, as 
16
the health and education systems struggle to re-
17
spond to the needs of this population in a com-
18
prehensive manner. 
19
(7) The prevalence of autism in developing 
20
countries is also growing rapidly, and health and 
21
education systems in these countries are particularly 
22
ill-equipped to deal with these issues. According to 
23
the World Health Organization, tens of millions of 
24
individuals in Africa are affected by autism. 
25

•HR 2077 IH
(8) Children with autism who receive intensive 
1
and appropriate educational services before age 5 
2
often make significant functional improvements. In 
3
the United States, significant efforts are being pur-
4
sued to expand early diagnosis and the provision of 
5
these services. In a report on the identification, eval-
6
uation, and management of children with autism, 
7
the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended 
8
in November 2007 that all children should be 
9
screened for developmental delays and disabilities, 
10
presumably including autism, twice by the age of 2, 
11
even if they have no symptoms. Early screening and 
12
services for autism are sorely lacking in most of the 
13
developing world. An opportunity exists to use 
14
United States expertise to significantly aid children 
15
and families in developing countries, for relatively 
16
small costs. 
17
(9) Hydrocephalus, also known as ‘‘water on 
18
the brain’’, is a medical condition in which an abnor-
19
mal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ven-
20
tricles or cavities of the brain causes increased 
21
intracranial pressure inside the skull and progressive 
22
enlargement of the head. If left untreated, hydro-
23
cephalus leads to physical and mental disabilities 
24
and eventually death. 
25

H2077

•HR 2077 IH
(10) Hydrocephalus is an extremely painful 
1
condition that most commonly occurs in infants and 
2
young children as a result of a congenital abnor-
3
mality (anatomic abnormality, aqueductal stenosis, 
4
spina bifida or encephalocele), or post-infectious hy-
5
drocephalus (PIH) caused by infections acquired 
6
after birth, such as meningitis, that attack the 
7
brain. 
8
(11) In developed countries, up to one of every 
9
1,000 newborns develop hydrocephalus, while up to 
10
five of every 1,000 newborns in developing countries 
11
develop the condition. It is conservatively estimated 
12
that more than 300,000 children are born with or 
13
acquire hydrocephalus in the developing world each 
14
year. Experts posit that hydrocephalus is more com-
15
mon in developing countries because of higher birth 
16
rates, as well as high rates of nutritional defi-
17
ciencies, low infant birth weight, and perinatal and 
18
neonatal infections. 
19
(12) Children with hydrocephalus who are not 
20
effectively treated or who are not treated in the early 
21
stages of the condition suffer from cognitive defi-
22
ciencies or physical disabilities or both. 
23
(13) Families of children who have hydro-
24
cephalus in developing countries rarely know that it 
25
01:21 Apr 17, 2019
H2077
6 
•HR 2077 IH
is a treatable condition, where to go for treatment, 
1
or how to care for a child suffering from the condi-
2
tion. In addition, access to care is limited in many 
3
developing countries due to low numbers of prac-
4
ticing neurosurgeons. In 2007, for example, Africa 
5
had 565 neurosurgeons, roughly 86 percent of whom 
6
were practicing in South Africa and Northern Afri-
7
ca. 
8
(14) Many children with hydrocephalus in de-
9
veloping countries are abandoned, ostracized, or 
10
abused due to their appearance, physical and mental 
11
disabilities, and inadequate options for care. 
12
(15) Hydrocephalus can be treated, and ad-
13
vances in innovative medical procedures such as 
14
ETV/CPC have the potential to save thousands of 
15
lives annually and prevent or mitigate physical and 
16
mental disabilities in thousands of children in devel-
17
oping countries. 
18
(16) A number of international studies show 
19
that between 3.5 to 15 percent of all patients diag-
20
nosed with Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia 
21
actually have Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a 
22
condition in which there is too much cerebrospinal 
23
fluid, used to cushion and protect the brain and spi-
24
nal cord, in cavities in the brain called ventricles. 
25
01:21 Apr 17, 2019
H2077

•HR 2077 IH
Such significant incidents of misdiagnosis illustrate 
1
the need for greater awareness among members of 
2
the medical profession and the general public of 
3
adult hydrocephalus, as well as the need for adopt-
4
ing a holistic approach towards brain health instead 
5
of a siloed one. 
6
(17) Dementia is a degenerative condition 
7
caused by disease of the brain—usually of a chronic 
8
or progressive nature in which there is disturbance 
9
of multiple higher cortical functions, including mem-
10
ory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calcula-
11
tion, learning capacity, language, and judgment. Be-
12
tween 5 to 7 percent of the world’s population age 
13
60 and above are estimated to have dementia. 
14
(18) Dementia can be caused by various fac-
15
tors, including traumatic or localized brain injury, a 
16
temporary interruption of the brain’s supply of blood 
17
or oxygen, infection, stroke, brain hemorrhage, pro-
18
longed seizures, or even excessive alcohol use. 
19
(19) According to Alzheimer’s Disease Inter-
20
national, more than 47,000,000 people worldwide 
21
were suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia in 
22
2015, a figure that will expand to more than 
23
75,000,000 people by 2030 and more than 
24
131,000,000 people by 2050 if the current trajectory 
25
01:21 Apr 17, 2019

•HR 2077 IH
of the disease remains unchanged. Globally, a new 
1
person develops dementia every four seconds. Almost 
2
60 percent of people with dementia globally live in 
3
low-to-middle income countries, and by 2050 this 
4
percentage will exceed 70 percent. 
5
(20) Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias 
6
impose a devastating, unsustainable, and rapidly 
7
growing toll on the health and fiscal well-being of 
8
the United States and all countries. In 2015, demen-
9
tia care cost an estimated $818,000,000,000, world-
10
wide, more than 1 percent of the world’s Gross Do-
11
mestic Product (GDP). The cost of dementia care is 
12
projected to reach $2,000,000,000,000 by 2030.
