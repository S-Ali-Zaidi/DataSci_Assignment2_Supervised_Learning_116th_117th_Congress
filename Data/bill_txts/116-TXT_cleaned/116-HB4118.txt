SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The Federal Bureau of Investigation defines 
3
‘‘hate crime’’ to be a criminal offense—such as mur-
4
der, arson, or vandalism—against a person or prop-
5
erty motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s 
6
bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual ori-
7
entation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity. 
8
(2) Forty-five States and the District of Colum-
9
bia have statutes criminalizing various types of bias- 
10
motivated violence or intimidation. 
11
(3) The Federal Government has implemented 
12
crimes statutes since 1968, with the most recent law 
13
enacted in 2009. 
14
(4) Approximately 250,000 hate crimes happen 
15
each year, yet only 2 percent are reported to the 
16
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 
17
(5) Hate crimes not only damage the individual 
18
victim or victims, but also traumatize entire commu-
19
nities and erode public confidence in their safety. 
20
(6) According to multiple, nonpartisan studies, 
21
hate crimes have increased each consecutive year 
22
since 2015, with a 6.7-percent increase in reported 
23
hate crimes in 2016, one of the largest 1-year in-
24
creases in over a decade.

(7) In May 2017, the FBI found that White su-
1
premacists and right wing extremist groups were re-
2
sponsible for the most of any domestic extremist 
3
group. 
4
(8) According to the same FBI report, hate 
5
crimes against LGBTQ people have been on the rise 
6
over the past three years, with a majority targeting 
7
gay men. 
8
(9) In addition, the FBI reported that hate 
9
crimes motivated by anti-religious bias increased 23 
10
percent, where 37 percent of that increase were anti- 
11
Jewish. 
12
(10) In February 2017, a White supremacist 
13
entered a bar in Kansas and shot at two Indian 
14
men, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani while 
15
shouting racial epithets. Srinivas later died of his in-
16
juries. 
17
(11) In August 2017, the White nationalist and 
18
neo-Nazi protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, re-
19
sulted in 1 death and 20 injuries from a White na-
20
tionalist driving his car into a group of counter-pro-
21
testers. 
22
(12) In July 2019, a Hindu priest in New York 
23
City was hospitalized after a man attacked him and

screamed ‘‘this is my neighborhood’’ during the inci-
1
dent. 
2
(13) There is a clear need for stronger action 
3
to accurately report and effectively combat hate- 
4
based attacks.
