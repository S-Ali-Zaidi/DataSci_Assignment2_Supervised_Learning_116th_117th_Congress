SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Scientific Assistance 
2
for Very Endangered North Atlantic Right Whales Act of 
3
2019’’ or the ‘‘SAVE Right Whales Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
6
(1) North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena 
7
glacialis) are critically endangered, with no more 
8
than 425 whales remaining at the time of the intro-
9
duction of this Act; 
10
(2) historically, the North Atlantic right whale 
11
population was decimated by the whaling industry; 
12
(3) despite protection from whaling beginning 
13
in the 1930s, the North Atlantic right whale is one 
14
of the most endangered whales in the world and has 
15
experienced a significant decline since 2010; 
16
(4) the North Atlantic right whale has been 
17
listed as an endangered species under the Endan-
18
gered Species Conservation Act of 1969 (Public Law 
19
89–669; 80 Stat. 926) and its successor the Endan-
20
gered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) 
21
since 1970 and is designated as depleted under the 
22
Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 
23
1361 et seq.); 
24
(5) because North Atlantic right whales are 
25
long-lived and highly migratory, and at present rates 
26
22:59 Mar 21, 2019
H1568

•HR 1568 IH
females give birth to a single calf only once every 4 
1
to 10 years, they are highly vulnerable to the im-
2
pacts of human activity and habitat degradation; 
3
(6) North Atlantic right whales frequently cross 
4
paths with major shipping lanes and fishing 
5
grounds, leaving the whales particularly vulnerable 
6
to vessel collisions and fishing gear entanglements, 
7
the 2 leading causes of injury and death to the spe-
8
cies; 
9
(7) even when North Atlantic right whales do 
10
not die as a result of fishing gear entanglement, 
11
those whales can still experience significant sub-le-
12
thal effects such as chronic stress and reproductive 
13
failure; 
14
(8) in August 2017, the National Marine Fish-
15
eries Service announced an Unusual Mortality Event 
16
involving North Atlantic right whales in 2017, with 
17
17 known whale deaths that year alone; 
18
(9) an Unusual Mortality Event involves a sig-
19
nificant die-off of a population and, according to the 
20
Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 
21
1361 et seq.), demands an immediate response; 
22
(10) based on the current rate of mortality of 
23
North Atlantic right whales, and because of the 
24
small number of breeding females in the population 
25

•HR 1568 IH
and low birth rates, recent analysis suggests the spe-
1
cies will lose its ability to recover in merely a few 
2
decades if human-caused mortality is not reduced 
3
immediately; 
4
(11) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
5
of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), United States 
6
fishermen in certain locations have been required to 
7
modify their fishing gear and behavior to minimize 
8
the likelihood of entanglements, including by using 
9
sinking groundlines, having weak links in buoy lines, 
10
using multiple traps per buoy, appropriately mark-
11
ing fishing gear, and complying with area closures 
12
during North Atlantic right whale migrations; 
13
(12) vessels in United States waters that are 65 
14
feet or more in length have been required to comply 
15
with a 10-knot speed limit in certain locations dur-
16
ing North Atlantic right whale migrations to reduce 
17
the threat of vessel collisions; and 
18
(13) North Atlantic right whales are now mi-
19
grating farther north into Canadian waters and in 
20
2017 there were at least 12 North Atlantic right 
21
whale deaths in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence, in 
22
addition to the 8 documented deaths in United 
23
States waters in 2017 and 2018.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
1
gress that— 
2
(1) the Governments of the United States and 
3
Canada must work together to reduce lethal and 
4
sub-lethal effects of human activities on North At-
5
lantic right whales; and 
6
(2) effectively addressing the threats to the 
7
long-term viability of the North Atlantic right 
8
whales will require a joint commitment and effort 
9
from government entities, local communities, marine 
10
scientists and conservationists, fishermen, owners 
11
and operators of passenger vessels and others in the 
12
shipping industry, and other stakeholders.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES. 
14
The purposes of this Act are the following: 
15
(1) To rebuild healthy populations of the North 
16
Atlantic right whale. 
17
(2) To assist in the conservation and protection 
18
of North Atlantic right whales by supporting North 
19
Atlantic right whale conservation programs that 
20
minimize conflicts between North Atlantic right 
21
whales and human activities. 
22
(3) To provide financial resources for those pro-
23
grams.
