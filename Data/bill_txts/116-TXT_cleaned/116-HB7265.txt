•HR 7265 IH
(1) The Office of the Director of National Intel-
1
ligence stated in its 2019 Worldwide Threat Assess-
2
ment that United States adversaries and strategic 
3
competitors will increasingly use cyber capabilities— 
4
including cyber espionage, attack, and influence—to 
5
seek political, economic, and military advantage over 
6
the United States and its allies. 
7
(2) The Department of Defense recognizes that 
8
small manufacturers operating in the defense supply 
9
chain are particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks be-
10
cause they frequently lack the necessary human and 
11
financial resources to protect themselves. 
12
(3) The Department of Defense is imple-
13
menting its Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certifi-
14
cation (CMMC) to protect Controlled Unclassified 
15
Information and critical United States technology 
16
and information from cyber theft and hacking. All 
17
defense contractors will need to comply with CMMC. 
18
(4) The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisi-
19
tion and Sustainment has stated that smaller com-
20
panies in the defense supply chain might not be able 
21
to afford the Department of Defense’s increasingly 
22
demanding cybersecurity requirements, but that the 
23
Department is committed to ensuring that such 
24
companies get the resources they need to comply.

(5) According to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
1
tics, there are more than 347,000 manufacturing es-
2
tablishments in the United States, of which 72 per-
3
cent have fewer than 20 employees and 99 percent 
4
have fewer than 500 employees.

(6) During the past 7 years the Hollings Manu-
6
facturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Centers 
7
have worked closely with the Department of Defense 
8
to bolster the resilience of the defense industrial 
9
base supply chain by providing cybersecurity services 
10
to small manufacturers. The MEP Centers have 
11
worked with more than 26,000 small- and medium- 
12
sized manufacturers nationwide in fiscal year 2019 
13
alone. 
14
(7) Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partner-
15
ship Centers are located in all 50 States and provide 
16
a nationwide network that is— 
17
(A) raising the awareness of small manu-
18
facturers to cyber threats; 
19
(B) helping small manufacturers comply 
20
with new Department of Defense cybersecurity 
21
requirements; and 
22
(C) helping small manufacturers under-
23
stand that if they do not comply with new De-

Partnership Centers are well-positioned to aid small

manufacturing companies in the defense supply

chain in complying with cybersecurity requirements

to protect controlled unclassified information rel-
