Whereas peanut cultivation originated from the Incas of Peru 
as early as 1500 B.C., and spread from South America 
to Spain, Asia, and Africa; 
Whereas, in the 1700s, Africans were the first to introduce 
peanuts to North Americans; 
Whereas, in the early 1800s, the steady growth of peanut 
production altered its reputation as food primarily for 
livestock and the poor to a high-protein and well-liked 
food source for Civil War soldiers; 
Whereas, in the early 1900s, demand for peanuts grew due 
to advances in harvesting and production methods mak-
ing peanuts and peanut products more easily available; 
Whereas Dr. Carver recommended peanuts as a crop to rival 
Southern cotton’s top commercial position, following its 
near destruction due to the boll weevil; 
Whereas thanks to Dr. Carver’s instrumental work in pro-
moting the peanut in the Wiregrass area of Alabama, the 
National Peanut Festival invited him to serve as their 
first guest speaker; 
Whereas, in 1938, the first National Peanut Festival was 
held in Dothan, Alabama; 
Whereas the first National Peanut Festival established— 
(1) the Miss Peanut Award, first won by Elizabeth 
Johnson from Headland, Alabama; and 
(2) the Volunteer of the Year Award, named in 
honor of the first festival president, Harry P. Hall, and 
awarded annually since its advent; 
Whereas, during its 81 years, the National Peanut Festival 
became an established nonprofit organization through a 
resolution passed by the Chamber of Commerce in 1952;

South in Dothan, Alabama, in 2010; 
Whereas peanuts remain a significant and valuable cash crop 
grown in the United States, which are— 
(1) valued at over $1,000,000,000; 
(2) consumed by American children and adults— 
roughly six pounds of peanut products per person each 
year—as both snack nuts and candy; and 
(3) used to create peanut oil, a high-quality cooking 
oil that Americans consume at 133,000,000 metric tons 
annually; 
Whereas approximately half of all peanuts grown in the 
United States originate within a 100-mile radius of 
Dothan, Alabama; and 
Whereas, in 2018, Alabama peanut farmers, of which there 
are close to 900—
