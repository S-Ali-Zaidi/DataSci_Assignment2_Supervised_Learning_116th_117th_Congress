A BILL 
To increase access to pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce 
the transmission of HIV. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘PrEP Access and Cov-
4

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
3
vention estimates that approximately 1,100,000 peo-
4
ple in the United States are living with HIV. 
5
(2) In 2017, there were 38,281 new diagnoses 
6
of HIV in the United States. 
7
(3) HIV disproportionately impacts gay and bi-
8
sexual men, transgender women, and, in particular, 
9
people of color. For example, in 2017 approximately 
10
66 percent of new HIV diagnoses were among gay 
11
and bisexual men, 43 percent of new HIV diagnoses 
12
were among Black people, and 26 percent of new 
13
HIV diagnoses were among Latinx people. Recent 
14
studies suggest that transgender women are up to 
15
49 times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV than 
16
the general population. Members of communities at 
17
the intersections of these groups are most heavily 
18
impacted. 
19
(4) Pre-exposure prophylaxis (referred to in this 
20
section as ‘‘PrEP’’) is a daily antiretroviral medica-
21
tion that helps prevent individuals from acquiring 
22
HIV. Daily PrEP use reduces the risk of getting 
23
HIV from sex by over 90 percent. It reduces the risk 
24
of getting HIV from injection drug use by over 70 
25
percent. 
26

•HR 3815 IH
(5) Many individuals at risk of exposure to HIV 
1
do not use PrEP. Of the approximately 1,100,000 
2
people in the United States who could benefit from 
3
PrEP, only 7 percent, or 78,360 individuals, filled 
4
prescriptions for the drug in 2016. 
5
(6) PrEP usage is inconsistent across racial 
6
and gender lines. In 2016, PrEP users were 68.7 
7
percent White, 11.2 percent Black, and 13.1 percent 
8
Latinx. However, individuals eligible for PrEP were 
9
26.3 percent White, 43.7 percent Black, and 24.7 
10
percent Latinx. Additionally, only 2.1 percent of 
11
women eligible for PrEP received a prescription in 
12
2016. 
13
(7) There is currently only one version of PrEP 
14
approved by the Food and Drug Administration, 
15
marketed under the brand name of Truvada, which, 
16
in 2018, had a list price of over $20,000 a year in 
17
the United States. A less expensive, generic version 
18
of PrEP is expected to be available in September 
19
2020, and other types of HIV prevention treat-
20
ments, including oral pills, vaginal rings, and long- 
21
acting injectables, are currently in the research pipe-
22
line. 
23
(8) Section 2713 of the Public Health Service 
24
Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–13) requires most private 
25
04:29 Aug 01, 2019
H3815
4 
•HR 3815 IH
health insurance plans to cover preventive services 
1
without cost sharing, including such services with a 
2
rating of ‘‘A’’ or ‘‘B’’ under recommendations of the 
3
United States Preventive Services Task Force. On 
4
June 11, 2019, the United States Preventive Serv-
5
ices Task Force issued a final recommendation giv-
6
ing an ‘‘A’’ grade for PrEP for individuals at high 
7
risk of HIV; non-grandfathered private health insur-
8
ance plans will have to cover PrEP for such individ-
9
uals without cost sharing by 2021. 
10
(9) Despite such recommendation of the United 
11
States Preventive Services Task Force, access bar-
12
riers to PrEP remain. Ancillary services necessary to 
13
maintain the PrEP regime, including subsequent 
14
provider visits, clinical testing, and other services, 
15
can remain a cost-burden on patients. Additionally, 
16
the new recommendations are not linked to coverage 
17
requirements for individuals with other types of in-
18
surance, such as Medicare or Medicaid. 
19
(10) Expanding access to cost-free PrEP and 
20
ancillary services for all individuals, including indi-
21
viduals who do not have health insurance, is a crit-
22
ical step towards eliminating HIV transmission.
