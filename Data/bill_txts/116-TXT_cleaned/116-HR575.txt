RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
all stakeholders in the deployment of 5G communications 
infrastructure should carefully consider and adhere to 
the recommendations of ‘‘The Prague Proposals’’. 
Whereas 5G, the next generation (5th generation) in wireless 
technology, promises the next evolution of communica-
tions and information technology services, applications, 
and capabilities across every sector of business, govern-
ment, entertainment, and communications; 
Whereas the United States, Europe, China, and others are 
racing toward 5G adoption and upgrading existing net-
works, which will drive subsequent advances in artificial

intelligence, machine learning, smart homes, smart cities, 
robotics, autonomous vehicles, and quantum computers; 
Whereas 5G will make possible the automatization of every-
day activities and the use of the full potential of the 
Internet of Things; 
Whereas these developments, while evolutionary, could include 
risks to important public interests, including privacy, 
data security, public safety, and national security; 
Whereas in a highly connected world, disruption of the integ-
rity, confidentiality, or availability of communications or 
even the disruption of the communications service itself 
can seriously hamper everyday life, societal functions, the 
economy, and national security; 
Whereas the security of 5G networks is crucial for national 
security, economic security, and other United States na-
tional interests and global stability; 
Whereas operators of communications infrastructure depend 
on a complex supply chain of technology from a global 
market of suppliers and service providers; 
Whereas government security officials and experts from 32 
countries came together in Prague in May of 2019 to 
work out guidelines for the deployment and security of 
5G networks; 
Whereas representatives agreed that ‘‘[m]ajor security risks 
emanate from the cross-border complexities of an increas-
ingly global supply chain which provides ICT equipment. 
These risks should be considered as part of the risk as-
sessment based on relevant information and should seek 
to prevent proliferation of compromised devices and the 
use of malicious code and functions.’’; and

SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
2
The House of Representatives— 
3
(1) urges all stakeholders in the deployment of 
4
5G communications infrastructure to carefully con-
5
sider adherence to the recommendations of ‘‘The 
6
Prague Principles’’ (as described in section 2) as 
7
they procure products and services across their sup-
8
ply chain; and 
9
(2) encourages the President and Federal agen-
10
cies to promote global trade and security policies 
11
that are consistent with ‘‘The Prague Proposals’’ 
12
and urge our allies to embrace the recommendations 
13
of ‘‘The Prague Proposals’’ for their public 5G in-

SEC. 2. PRAGUE PROPOSALS. 
16
The text of ‘‘The Prague Proposals’’ is as follows: 
17
(1) ‘‘POLICY’’.— 
18
(A) ‘‘Communication networks and services 
19
should be designed with resilience and security 
20
in mind. They should be built and maintained 
21
using 
international, 
open, 
consensus-based 
22
standards and risk-informed cybersecurity best

practices. Clear globally interoperable cyber se-
1
curity guidance that would support cyber secu-
2
rity products and services in increasing resil-
3
ience of all stakeholders should be promoted.’’. 
4
(B) ‘‘Every country is free, in accordance 
5
with international law, to set its own national 
6
security and law enforcement requirements, 
7
which should respect privacy and adhere to laws 
8
protecting information from improper collection 
9
and misuse.’’. 
10
(C) ‘‘Laws and policies governing networks 
11
and connectivity services should be guided by 
12
the principles of transparency and equitability, 
13
taking into account the global economy and 
14
interoperable rules, with sufficient oversight 
15
and respect for the rule of law.’’. 
16
(D) ‘‘The overall risk of influence on a 
17
supplier by a third country should be taken into 
18
account, notably in relation to its model of gov-
19
ernance, the absence of cooperation agreements 
20
on security, or similar arrangements, such as 
21
adequacy decisions, as regards data protection, 
22
or whether this country is a party to multilat-
23
eral, international or bilateral agreements on

1
data protection.’’. 
2
(2) ‘‘TECHNOLOGY’’.— 
3
(A) ‘‘Stakeholders should regularly conduct 
4
vulnerability assessments and risk mitigation 
5
within all components and network systems, 
6
prior to product release and during system op-
7
eration, and promote a culture of find/fix/patch 
8
to mitigate identified vulnerabilities and rapidly 
9
deploy fixes or patches.’’. 
10
(B) ‘‘Risk assessments of supplier’s prod-
11
ucts should take into account all relevant fac-
12
tors, including applicable legal environment and 
13
other aspects of supplier’s ecosystem, as these 
14
factors may be relevant to stakeholders’ efforts 
15
to maintain the highest possible level of cyber 
16
security.’’. 
17
(C) ‘‘When building up resilience and secu-
18
rity, it should be taken into consideration that 
19
malicious cyber activities do not always require 
20
the exploitation of a technical vulnerability, e.g. 
21
in the event of insider attack.’’. 
22
(D) ‘‘In order to increase the benefits of 
23
global communication, States should adopt poli-

2
(E) ‘‘Stakeholders should take into consid-
3
eration technological changes accompanying 5G 
4
networks roll out, e.g. use of edge computing 
5
and software defined network/network function 
6
virtualization, and its impact on overall security 
7
of communication channels.’’. 
8
(F) ‘‘Customer—whether the government, 
9
operator, or manufacturer—must be able to be 
10
informed about the origin and pedigree of com-
11
ponents and software that affect the security 
12
level of the product or service, according to 
13
state of art and relevant commercial and tech-
14
nical practices, including transparency of main-
15
tenance, updates, and remediation of the prod-
16
ucts and services.’’. 
17
(3) ‘‘ECONOMY’’.— 
18
(A) ‘‘A diverse and vibrant communica-
19
tions equipment market and supply chain are 
20
essential for security and economic resilience.’’. 
21
(B) ‘‘Robust investment in research and 
22
development benefits the global economy and

technological advancement and is a way to po-

tentially increase diversity of technological solu-

tions with positive effects on security of commu-

nication networks.’’. 
2
(C) ‘‘Communication networks and net-
3
work services should be financed openly and 
4
transparently using standard best practices in 
5
procurement, investment, and contracting.’’. 
6
(D) ‘‘State-sponsored incentives, subsidies, 
7
or financing of 5G communication networks 
8
and service providers should respect principles 
9
of fairness, be commercially reasonable, con-
10
ducted openly and transparently, based on open 
11
market competitive principles, while taking into 
12
account trade obligations.’’. 
13
(E) ‘‘Effective oversight on key financial 
14
and investment instruments influencing tele-
15
communication network development is crit-
16
ical.’’.

ownership, partnerships, and corporate govern-
20
ance structures.’’.

1
works, systems, and connected devices.’’. 
2
(B) ‘‘Sharing experience and best prac-
3
tices, including assistance, as appropriate, with 
4
mitigation, investigation, response, and recovery 
5
from network attacks, compromises, or disrup-
6
tions should be promoted.’’. 
7
(C) ‘‘Security and risk assessments of ven-
8
dors and network technologies should take into 
9
account rule of law, security environment, ven-
10
dor malfeasance, and compliance with open, 
11
interoperable, secure standards, and industry 
12
best practices to promote a vibrant and robust 
13
cyber security supply of products and services 
14
to deal with the rising challenges.’’.

(D) ‘‘Risk management framework in a 
16
manner that respects data protection principles
