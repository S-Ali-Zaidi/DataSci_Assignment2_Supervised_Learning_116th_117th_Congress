Whereas currently over 50 municipalities and 10 States cele-
brate Indigenous Peoples’ Day on the second Monday of 
October; 
Whereas Columbus Day is a Federal holiday, established by 
order of President Roosevelt in 1937, and is officially rec-
ognized by some cities and States around the country on 
the second Monday of October; 
Whereas Columbus Day does not currently provide an oppor-
tunity to reflect on the colonization of North America by 
Europeans; 
Whereas, prior to colonization, Indigenous Peoples lived and 
flourished in the Americas for thousands of years; 
Whereas the European colonization of North America led to 
the suppression, forced assimilation, and genocide of In-
digenous Peoples and their cultures; 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes and values 
the vast contributions made to the United States by In-
digenous Peoples’ knowledge, science, philosophy, arts, 
and culture; 
Whereas it is the responsibility of the House of Representa-
tives to foster inclusivity, racial equity, and justice for all 
people and oppose systemic practices that perpetuate op-
pression; 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes its respon-
sibility to honor the Nation’s indigenous roots, history, 
traditions, and cultural contributions; and 
Whereas the second Monday in October would be an appro-
priate date to designate as ‘‘Indigenous Peoples’ Day’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
