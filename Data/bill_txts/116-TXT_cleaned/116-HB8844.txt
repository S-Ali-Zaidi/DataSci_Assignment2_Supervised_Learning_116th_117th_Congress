(1) The Badr Organization, founded in 1983 as 
1
the military arm of the Supreme Council for the Is-
2
lamic Revolution in Iraq, is Iran’s oldest and most

preeminent proxy in Iraq, a political party which 
4
supported Ayatollah Khomeni’s Islamic revolution in 
5
Iran and desired to export it to Iraq. 
6
(2) The Badr Organization is provided training, 
7
funding, and arms by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary 
8
Guard Corps (IRGC), IRGC-Quds Force, and works 
9
closely with Kata’ib Hezbollah (KH), Lebanese 
10
Hezbollah, and Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH), all of 
11
which have been designated as Foreign Terrorist Or-
12
ganizations by the Department of State. 
13
(3) Reports confirm that on December 31, 
14
2019, Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes, the now deceased 
15
deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization 
16
Force and terrorist leader of Hezbollah, led a mob 
17
of Iranian-backed Iraq militia groups to the United 
18
States Embassy in Iraq and set fire to the building.

With him was Badr Organization leader, Hadi al- 
20
Amiri. 
21
(4) The Badr Organization has a history of tar-
22

4
majority.
