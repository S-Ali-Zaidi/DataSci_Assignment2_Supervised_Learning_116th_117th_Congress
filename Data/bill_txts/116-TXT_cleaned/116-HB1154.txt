A BILL 
To provide collective bargaining rights for public safety offi-
cers employed by States or their political subdivisions, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Public Safety Em-
4
ployer-Employee Cooperation Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND POLICY. 
6
Congress declares that the following is the policy of 
7
the United States: 
8
(1) Labor-management relationships and part-
9
nerships are based on trust, mutual respect, open 
10

communication, bilateral consensual problem solving, 
1
and shared accountability. Labor-management co-
2
operation fully utilizes the strengths of both parties 
3
to best serve the interests of the public, operating as 
4
a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a 
5
quality work environment. In many public safety 
6
agencies, it is the union that provides the institu-
7
tional stability as elected leaders and appointees 
8
come and go. 
9
(2) State and local public safety officers play an 
10
essential role in the efforts of the United States to 
11
detect, prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and 
12
to respond to natural disasters, hazardous materials, 
13
and other mass casualty incidents. State and local 
14
public safety officers, as first responders, are a com-
15
ponent of the National Incident Management Sys-
16
tem, developed by the Department of Homeland Se-
17
curity to coordinate response to and recovery from 
18
terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major 
19
emergencies. Public safety employer-employee co-
20
operation is essential in meeting these needs and is, 
21
therefore, in the National interest. 
22
(3) The Federal Government needs to encour-
23
age conciliation, mediation, and arbitration to aid 
24
and encourage employers and the representatives of 
25
01:50 Feb 23, 2019

their employees to reach and maintain agreements 
1
concerning rates of pay, hours, and working condi-
2
tions, and to make all reasonable efforts through ne-
3
gotiations to settle their differences by mutual agree-
4
ment reached through collective bargaining or by 
5
such methods as may be provided for in any applica-
6
ble agreement for the settlement of disputes. 
7
(4) The absence of adequate cooperation be-
8
tween public safety employers and employees has im-
9
plications for the security of employees and can af-
10
fect interstate and intrastate commerce. The lack of 
11
such labor-management cooperation can detrimen-
12
tally impact the upgrading of law enforcement, fire, 
13
and emergency medical services of local commu-
14
nities, the health and well-being of public safety offi-
15
cers, and the morale of law enforcement, fire, and 
16
EMS departments. Additionally, these factors could 
17
have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, 
18
providing minimal standards for collective bar-
19
gaining negotiations in the public safety sector can 
20
prevent industrial strife between labor and manage-
21
ment that interferes with the normal flow of com-
22
merce. 
23
(5) Many States and localities already provide 
24
public safety officers with collective bargaining 
25

rights comparable to or greater than the rights and

responsibilities set forth in this Act, and such State 
2
and local laws should be respected.
