SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
Whereas historical declarations of national emer-
2
gencies set a precedent of ‘‘governing by national emer-
3
gency’’ without approval from Congress; 
4
Whereas courts have a limited role with respect to 
5
challenges to Federal law; 
6
Whereas Congress has failed to guard its own appro-
7
priations authority and has thereby endowed executives 
8
with more unchecked power and undedicated funds; 
9
Whereas Congress has mistakenly given the executive 
10
historically unrestrained authority through the National 
11
Emergencies Act of 1976; 
12
Whereas the National Emergencies Act has offered 
13
the executive billions of dollars without clear conditions 
14
that Congress is endowed with the necessary authority to 
15
prescribe; 
16
Whereas Congress intends to assert its constitutional 
17
authority and protect the checks the body was intended 
18
to place on the executive branch of government; now there-
19
fore 
20
It is the sense of Congress that any executive action 
21
issued by the President before, on, or after the date of 
22
enactment of this Act that infringes on the powers and 
23
duties of Congress under section 8 and section 9 of article 
24
I of the Constitution of the United States, or that would 
25
require the expenditure of Federal funds not specifically

8

12
period by law. 
13
Once the President has issued a national emergency 
14
declaration under the National Emergencies Act a resolu-
15
tion affirmatively authorizing the action and/or extending 
16
