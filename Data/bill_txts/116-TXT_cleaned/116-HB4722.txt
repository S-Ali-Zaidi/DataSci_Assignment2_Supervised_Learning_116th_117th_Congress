Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Support UNFPA 
4
Funding Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United Nations Population Fund 
8
(UNFPA), is the United Nations Reproductive 
9
Health Agency. 
10
(2) UNFPA was founded with the leadership of 
11
the United States 50 years ago and works in more 
12
than 150 countries to end preventable maternal 
13
deaths, the unmet need for contraception, and gen-
14
der-based violence and other harmful practices, in-
15
cluding female genital mutilation and child mar-
16
riage. 
17
(3) UNFPA also ensures access to health care 
18
and essential supplies for women and families im-
19
pacted by emergencies. 
20
(4) All UNFPA programming is guided by 
21
principles adopted by 179 governments, including

the United States, at the 1994 International Con-
1
ference for Population and Development. The prin-
2
ciples include that ‘‘reproductive health care pro-
3
grams should provide the widest range of services 
4
without any form of coercion. All couples and indi-
5
viduals have the basic right to decide freely and re-
6
sponsibly the number and spacing of their children 
7
and to have the information, education and means to 
8
do so.’’ 
9
(5) UNFPA is currently working to address the 
10
needs of: 
11
(A) The 810 women and adolescent girls 
12
who die each day from preventable causes re-
13
lated to pregnancy and childbirth, 99 percent of 
14
which deaths occur in developing countries and 
15
more than half of which occur in fragile and 
16
humanitarian settings. 
17
(B) More than 214,000,000 women of re-
18
productive age in developing regions who want 
19
to avoid pregnancy and are not using a modern 
20
contraceptive method. 
21
(C) The estimated 1 in 3 women who expe-
22
rience gender-based violence.

(D) The estimated 200,000,000 women 
1
who have survived some form of female genital 
2
mutilation. 
3
(E) The estimated 15,000,000 girls who 
4
are forcibly married before the age of 18 each 
5
year. 
6
(6) Prior to withholding contributions in 2017, 
7
the United States was the third-largest overall donor 
8
to UNFPA, and its second-largest donor for human-
9
itarian response. 
10
(7) UNFPA, which works in three times as 
11
many countries as the United States Agency for 
12
International Development, extends the impact of 
13
United States foreign assistance by reaching people 
14
in politically unstable regions. UNFPA also plays a 
15
pivotal role in meeting protection and health care 
16
needs in countries experiencing humanitarian emer-
17
gencies like Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. 
18
(8) Voluntary family planning is central to gen-
19
der equality and women’s empowerment, and it is a 
20
key factor in reducing poverty. 
21
(9) The United States has conflated UNFPA’s 
22
presence in China with supporting China’s coercive 
23
birth limitation policies. However, in June 2015, the 
24
U.S. State Department visited UNFPA’s China

Country Program to design and approve it as a 
1
member of UNFPA’s Executive Board, noting that 
2
‘‘[d]uring its recent visit, the U.S. delegation ob-
3
served the positive impact of UNFPA’s rights-based 
4
programming in China. We commend the Fund’s ad-
5
herence to demonstrating the advantages of a vol-
6
untary approach to family planning.’’ The Program 
7
in China has not changed since it was approved by 
8
the United States in 2015. 
9
(10) On July 8, 2019, the Department of State 
10
made a determination to eliminate all contributions 
11
to UNFPA for the third consecutive year based on 
12
its interpretation of the Kemp-Kasten Amendment 
13
(first enacted in Public Law 99–88; 99 Stat. 323). 
14
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
15

16

6
(5) UNFPA helps ensure that family planning 
7
and reproductive health programs are voluntary and 
8

9

10

11
health, development, and human rights, and the 
12
Government of the United States is committed to 
13
providing
