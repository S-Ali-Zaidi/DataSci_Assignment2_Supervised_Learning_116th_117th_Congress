•HR 2248 IH
(1) the exportation of natural gas produced in 
1
the United States is in the interest of the United 
2
States; and 
3
(2) because natural gas produced in the United 
4
States has a lower greenhouse gas emissions profile 
5
than other energy sources used in high volumes in 
6
other countries, the exportation of natural gas from 
7
the United States may help lower global emissions of 
8
carbon dioxide.
