•HR 1360 IH
(1) According to data from the Department of 
1
Veterans Affairs, several medical centers of the De-
2
partment are managed by acting or temporary direc-
3
tors. 
4
(2) Some of these medical centers have not 
5
been managed by a permanent director for a long 
6
period. 
7
(3) Pursuant to section 317.903 of title 5, Code 
8
of Federal Regulations, a member of the senior exec-
9
utive service who is detailed to a temporary position 
10
in a department or agency of the Federal Govern-
11
ment may not serve in that position for periods 
12
longer than 120-day increments, and no member of 
13
the senior executive service may be detailed to an 
14
unclassified position for a period longer than 240 
15
days. 
16
(4) The inability of the Department of Veterans 
17
Affairs to recruit qualified, permanent candidates as 
18
directors of medical centers, combined with the poli-
19
cies described in paragraph (3), leads to frequent 
20
turnover of directors at the medical centers which 
21
impedes the ability of system management to engage 
22
in long-term planning and other functions necessary 
23
to improve service delivery to veterans.
