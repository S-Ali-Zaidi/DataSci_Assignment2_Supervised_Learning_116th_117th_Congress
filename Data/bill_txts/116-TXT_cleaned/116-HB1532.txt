SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Although the United States poverty rate has 
9
had a slight decline to 12.3 percent in 2017, poverty 
10
remains a social issue for our Nation, especially for 
11
communities of color and women and children who 
12
continue to experience higher than average poverty 
13
rates. Homeowners and those seeking to become 
14
homeowners continue to face challenges with high 
15
mortgage delinquency, mortgage loan interest rates, 
16

and threats of foreclosure. Joblessness and economic 
1
insecurity contribute to the incidence of mental ill-
2
ness, family violence, suicide, substance abuse, 
3
crime, and diminished capacity for health, family, 
4
and community functioning. 
5
(2) Social workers form society’s social safety 
6
net. Social workers provide assistance, guidance, and 
7
resources to individuals, families, and communities 
8
in poverty. Additionally, they understand the dev-
9
astating costs and consequences of poverty and un-
10
employment on our society and provide direct serv-
11
ices in order to prevent and abate economic inequal-
12
ity. 
13
(3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 
14
that the social work profession will grow at an 
15
above-average rate through the year 2026, with a 
16
16-percent growth rate overall and a 20-percent pro-
17
jected growth rate for health care social workers. 
18
This increase is faster than the 7-percent average 
19
for all occupations, demonstrating a substantial need 
20
for social workers in our Nation. 
21
(4) Social work salaries, on average, are among 
22
the lowest for all occupations in the United States 
23
and for those with master’s level education in par-
24
ticular. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
25
20:58 Mar 19, 2019
H1532
4 
•HR 1532 IH
the median annual income for social workers in 
1
2017 was $47,980. 
2
(5) The report titled ‘‘2017 Statistics on Social 
3
Work Education in the United States’’ by the Coun-
4
cil on Social Work Education stated that 77.7 per-
5
cent of students graduating from Master of Social 
6
Work programs incurred debt to earn their graduate 
7
degree. The average debt for a Master of Social 
8
Work degree was approximately $44,296. 
9
(6) Social workers often deal with the most vul-
10
nerable clients in emotional or traumatic situations, 
11
and face possible danger as a result. The National 
12
Association of Social Workers Center for Workforce 
13
Studies found that 44 percent of survey respondents 
14
faced personal safety issues on the job. In 2015, the 
15
Occupational Safety and Health Administration re-
16
ported that 75 percent of workplace assaults that oc-
17
curred between 2011 and 2013 took place in the 
18
health care and social services industries. 
19
(7) The Alzheimer’s Association of America 
20
states that 5.7 million Americans, or 1 in every 10 
21
individuals over the age of 65, have Alzheimer’s dis-
22
ease. Social workers in gerontology settings work 
23
with older adults, including those with dementia, to 
24
support their physiological, psychological, and social

needs through mental health therapy, caregiver and 
1
family counseling, health education, program coordi-
2
nation, and case management. 
3
(8) The Children’s Defense Fund states that 
4
every 47 seconds a child is confirmed as abused or 
5
neglected and every 51⁄2 hours a child is killed from 
6
abuse or neglect. The Administration for Children 
7
and Families of the Department of Health and 
8
Human Services states that 437,500 children were 
9
in the United States foster care system at the end 
10
of fiscal year 2016. Most children placed in foster 
11
care are placed due to parental abuse or neglect. Re-
12
search shows that professional social workers em-
13
ployed in child welfare agencies are more likely to 
14
find permanent homes for children who have been in 
15
foster care for 2 or more years. Unfortunately, less 
16
than 40 percent of child welfare workers are profes-
17
sional social workers. 
18
(9) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
19
Services Administration of the Department of 
20
Health and Human Services estimates that 46.6 mil-
21
lion individuals (nearly 1 in 5 or 18.9 percent) in 
22
the United States age 18 or older experienced a 
23
diagnosable mental illness in 2017. Additionally, at 
24
least 3 million (1 in 10 or 13.3 percent) youth be-
25
20:58 Mar 19, 2019

•HR 1532 IH
tween the ages of 12 and 17 experienced at least one 
1
major depressive episode in the past year. Social 
2
workers provide the majority of mental health coun-
3
seling services in the United States, and are often 
4
the only providers of such services in rural areas. 
5
(10) Social workers working with veterans and 
6
their families provide services that include case man-
7
agement, crisis interventions, mental health inter-
8
ventions, housing and financial counseling, high-risk 
9
screening, and advocacy. The Department of Vet-
10
erans Affairs, which is the largest employer of social 
11
workers in the Nation, employs over 12,000 social 
12
workers who are available to serve an estimated 20.4 
13
million veterans in the United States. A once-declin-
14
ing veteran population is now surging and is in dire 
15
need of mental health treatment to address issues 
16
such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, 
17
drug and alcohol addiction, and suicidal tendencies. 
18
(11) The American Cancer Society estimated 
19
that there would be 1,735,350 new cases of cancer 
20
and 609,640 cancer deaths, or 1,670 deaths a day, 
21
in 2018 alone. The Centers for Disease Control and 
22
Prevention report that there are over 1,100,000 peo-
23
ple living with HIV in the United States, with ap-
24
proximately 38,500 new cases diagnosed in 2015. In 
25
20:58 Mar 19, 2019
H1532
7 
•HR 1532 IH
2017, 1,430,000 to 1,700,000 people received care 
1
from the Nation’s hospice providers. Health care 
2
and medical social workers practice in areas related 
3
to all of these circumstances and provide outreach 
4
for prevention and health promotion, help individ-
5
uals and their families adapt to their health condi-
6
tions, connect patients and family caregivers with 
7
community services and supports, provide grief 
8
counseling, and act as a liaison between individuals 
9
and their medical team, helping patients make in-
10
formed decisions about their care. 
11
(12) The Children’s Defense Fund notes that 
12
every 2 seconds a public school student is suspended 
13
and that every 9 seconds a high school student drops 
14
out. The National Center for Education Statistics 
15
states that in 2016 the national dropout rate for 
16
high school students was 6.1 percent. Some vulner-
17
able communities have dropout rates of 50 percent 
18
or higher. Social workers in school settings help stu-
19
dents avoid dropping out through early identifica-
20
tion, prevention, intervention, counseling, and sup-
21
port services. 
22
(13) According to the Department of Justice, 
23
every year more than 650,000 ex-offenders are re-
24
leased from Federal and State prisons. Social work-
