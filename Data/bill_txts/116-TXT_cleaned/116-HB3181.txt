A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Defense to enter into a contract 
with an eligible institution to carry out research and 
education activities relating to military painting. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Military Readiness and 
4
Cost Savings Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Bob Stump National Defense Author-
8
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107– 
9
03:02 Jun 13, 2019
H3181
2 
•HR 3181 IH
314), which passed with broad bipartisan support, 
1
established an Office of Corrosion Policy and Over-
2
sight within the Office of the Under Secretary of 
3
Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. The office 
4
was created to ‘‘oversee and coordinate efforts 
5
throughout the Department of Defense to prevent 
6
and mitigate corrosion of the military equipment and 
7
infrastructure of the Department’’. 
8
(2) Corrosion of the equipment and infrastruc-
9
ture of the Department of Defense (referred to in 
10
this section as the ‘‘Department’’) is expensive and 
11
impedes military readiness. According to a study 
12
commissioned by the Department’s Office of Corro-
13
sion Policy and Oversight, corrosion costs the De-
14
partment $20.6 billion annually across all services. 
15
These costs comprise 21 percent of the Depart-
16
ment’s total maintenance costs across all services. 
17
Corrosion is responsible for 11 percent, or roughly 
18
1.1 million, of all non-available days for Department 
19
assets. 
20
(3) 
Chemical-agent-resistant-coatings, 
which 
21
help to protect military vehicles and equipment from 
22
chemical and biological weapons and severe environ-
23
mental conditions that cause corrosion, can range in 
24
price from $100 to $800 per gallon. With approxi-
25

H3181

•HR 3181 IH
mately 3,760 assets of varying sizes painted at a 
1
typical Department depot per year, such coatings 
2
comprise a significant annual cost category for the 
3
operation of the facility and the maintenance of mili-
4
tary assets, according to analysis from the South-
5
west Research Institute. 
6
(4) Military painter training and certification 
7
helps reduce waste and rework of military assets, re-
8
ducing the costs associated with the application of 
9
chemical-agent-resistant-coatings. For example, one 
10
military painter training and certification provider 
11
helped Letterkenny Army Depot use 8,100 fewer 
12
gallons of such coatings per year, saving the depot 
13
$500,000 per year through improved transfer effi-
14
ciency and reduced rework, according to the South-
15
west Research Institute. 
16
(5) The Senate Report accompanying S. 1519 
17
(115th Congress; the National Defense Authoriza-
18
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2018) included language 
19
recognizing the importance of military painter train-
20
ing, noting that ‘‘paint training programs can save 
21
the Department time and funding resources by using 
22
advanced technology and equipment along with 
23
hands-on training to effectively apply coatings and 
24
reduce waste. Additionally, increasing coating trans-
25

fer efficiency and preventing corrosion and rework 
1
can improve asset readiness’’. 
2
(6) Investing in military painter and coating 
3
training and certification programs helps improve 
4
military readiness, increases safety for service mem-
5
bers, and reduces paint costs. It is prudent for Con-
6
gress to invest in research that will foster innova-
7
tions in those areas. 
8
(7) The importance of corrosion resistance goes 
9
beyond Department assets. Across nearly every sec-
10
tor, corrosion is expensive and poses a safety risk to 
11
users. For example, decaying roads and bridges cost 
12
the United States economy $5,000,000,000 a year, 
13
according to the National Association of Corrosion 
14
Engineers. Congress has a duty to pair Federal in-
15
frastructure investment with corrosion management 
16
to ensure new and existing public infrastructure is 
17
built to last. 
18
(8) The proper application of anticorrosion 
19
coatings requires a high degree of knowledge and 
20
skill. According to the International Union of Paint-
21
ers and Allied Trades, a poorly executed corrosion 
22
prevention project will leave an asset unprotected, 
23
increase costs to repair or replace all or parts of it, 
24
and irresponsibly use taxpayer dollars. Using trained 
25

and certified painters is the most effective way to 
1
ensure assets are truly protected from corrosion.
