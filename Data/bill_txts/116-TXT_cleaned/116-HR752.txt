ly any acts of violence committed by this regime against

Whereas, on November 21, 2019, the European Union stated 
that, ‘‘The protests in several Iranian cities over the past 
days have, according to reports, led to serious loss of life 
and left many people injured. We convey our condolences 
to the families of victims and wish a speedy recovery to 
those injured. Socio-economic challenges should be ad-
dressed through inclusive dialogue and not through the 
use of violence. We expect Iran’s security forces to exer-
cise maximum restraint in handling the protests and for 
protestors to demonstrate peacefully. Any violence is un-
acceptable. The rights to freedom of expression and as-
sembly must be guaranteed. We also expect the Iranian 
authorities to ensure the free flow of information and ac-
cess to the internet.’’;
