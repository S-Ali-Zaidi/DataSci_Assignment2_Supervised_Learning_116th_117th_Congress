‘‘SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
‘‘Congress finds the following: 
2
‘‘(1) The Government of Belarus, led by 
3
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to engage in a 
4
pattern of clear and persistent violations of human 
5
rights and fundamental freedoms. 
6
‘‘(2) The Government of Belarus, led by 
7
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to engage in a 
8
pattern of clear and uncorrected violations of basic 
9
principles 
of 
democratic 
governance, 
including 
10
through a series of fundamentally flawed presi-
11
dential and parliamentary elections undermining the 
12
legitimacy of executive and legislative authority in 
13
that country. 
14
‘‘(3) The Government of Belarus, led by 
15
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to subject thou-
16
sands of pro-democracy political activists and peace-
17
ful protesters to harassment, beatings, and imprison-
18
ment, particularly as a result of their attempts to 
19
peacefully exercise their right to freedom of assem-
20
bly and association.

‘‘(4) The Government of Belarus, led by 
22
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to suppress inde-

pendent media and journalists and to restrict access 
24

right to freedom of speech and expression of those 
1
dissenting from the dictatorship of Alyaksandr 
2
Lukashenka.

‘‘(5) The Government of Belarus, led by 
4
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues a systematic 
5
campaign of harassment, repression, and closure of 
6
nongovernmental 
organizations, 
including 
inde-
7
pendent trade unions and entrepreneurs, creating a 
8
climate of fear that inhibits the development of civil 
9
society and social solidarity. 
10
‘‘(6) The Government of Belarus, led by 
11
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, has pursued a policy un-
12
dermining the country’s sovereignty and independ-
13
ence by making Belarus political, economic, cultural, 
14
and societal interests subservient to those of Russia. 
15
‘‘(7) The Government of Belarus, led by 
16
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to reduce the 
17
independence of Belarus through integration into a 
18
so-called ‘Union State’ that is under the control of 
19
Russia. 
20
‘‘(8) On August 9, 2020, the Government of 
21
Belarus conducted a presidential election that was 
22
fraudulent and did not meet international standards. 
23
There were serious irregularities with ballot counting 
24
and the reporting of election results. The Govern-

ment of Belarus also put in place restrictive meas-
1
ures that impeded the work of local independent ob-
2
servers and did not provide sufficient notice to the 
3
OSCE to allow for the OSCE to monitor the elec-
4
tions, as is customary. 
5
‘‘(9) After the August 9, 2020, presidential 
6
election, the Government of Belarus responded to 
7
the peaceful opposition protests, which are the larg-
8
est in Belarus history, with a violent crackdown, in-
9
cluding, according to the United Nations Special 
10
Rapporteur, the detention of more than 10,000 
11
peaceful protestors as of September 18, 2020. 
12
‘‘(10) Thousands of employees at Belarusian 
13
state-owned enterprises, who have been seen as 
14
Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s traditional base during his 
15
26-year rule, went on strike across the country to 
16
protest Lukashenka’s illegitimate election and the 
17
subsequent crackdowns, including at some of 
18
Belarus’s largest factories such as the BelAZ truck 
19
plant, the Minsk Tractor Works, and the Minsk 
20
Automobile Plant.

2
‘‘(12) After the August 9, 2020, presidential 
3
election, the Government of Belarus has sought to 
4
stop the work of the Coordination Council, which 
5
was formed by the leading opposition presidential 
6
candidate, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, to facilitate a 
7
peaceful transition of power by subjecting the Coun-
8
cil’s senior members to violence, detention, and 
9
forced exile. 
10
‘‘(13) After the August 9, 2020, presidential 
11
election, the Government of Belarus restricted the 
12
free flow of information to silence the opposition and 
13
to conceal the regime’s violent crackdown on peace-
14
ful protestors, including by stripping the accredita-
15
tion of journalists from major foreign news outlets, 
16
disrupting internet access, limiting access to social 
17
media and other digital communication platforms, 
18
and detaining and harassing countless journalists. 
19
‘‘(14) Before the European Parliament on Au-
20
gust 25, 2020, Tsikhanouskaya stressed that a 
21
‘peaceful revolution’ was underway in Belarus, and 
22
that ‘It is neither a pro-Russian nor anti-Russian 
23
revolution. It is neither an anti-European Union nor

2
‘‘(15) Against the will of the majority of the 
3
Belarusian people, Russian President Vladimir Putin 
4
has propped up the Alyaksandr Lukashenka regime, 
5
including by offering security assistance, providing 
6
significant financial support, and sending Russian 
7
propagandists to help disseminate pro-regime propa-
8
ganda on Belarus state television. 
9
‘‘(16) After the August 9, 2020, presidential 
10
election, the United States, the European Union, the 
11
United Kingdom, and Canada condemned the violent 
12
crackdown on peaceful protestors, refused to accept 
13
the results of the fraudulent election and called for 
14
new free and fair elections under independent obser-
15
vation. 
16
‘‘(17) On September 8, 2020, Secretary of 
17
State Michael R. Pompeo said, ‘The United States, 
18
in coordination with our partners and Allies, is con-
19
sidering additional targeted sanctions to promote ac-
