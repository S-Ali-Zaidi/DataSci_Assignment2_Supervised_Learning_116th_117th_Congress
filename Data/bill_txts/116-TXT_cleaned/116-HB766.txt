(b) AGGREGATE DOLLAR LIMITATION.— 
1
(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sub-
2
section, the aggregate amount of distributions re-
3
ceived by an individual which may be treated as

(2) TREATMENT OF PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS.— 
10
(A) IN GENERAL.—If a distribution to an 
11
individual would (without regard to paragraph 
12
(1)) be a qualified shutdown distribution, a plan 
13
shall not be treated as violating any provision 
14
of law merely because the plan treats such dis-
15
tribution as a qualified shutdown distribution, 
16
unless the aggregate amount of such distribu-
17
tions from all plans maintained by the employer 
18
(and any member of any controlled group which 
19
includes the employer) to such individual ex-
20
ceeds the limitation amount with respect to 
21
such individual. Plans may require such sub-
22
stantiation and certification of the individual’s 
23
compensation as may be necessary for purposes 
24
of the preceding sentence.
