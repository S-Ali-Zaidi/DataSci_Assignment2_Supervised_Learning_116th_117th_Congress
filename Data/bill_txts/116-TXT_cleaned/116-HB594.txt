•HR 594 IH
(1) An estimated 6 million people in the United 
1
States, or 1 in 50 people, have an unruptured brain 
2
aneurysm. 
3
(2) Each year, an estimated 30,000 people in 
4
the United States suffer a brain aneurysm rupture. 
5
Ruptured brain aneurysms are fatal in about 40 per-
6
cent of cases. Of those who survive, about 66 per-
7
cent suffer some permanent neurological deficit. 
8
(3) Brain aneurysms are more likely to occur in 
9
women than in men by a 3 to 2 ratio. People who 
10
experienced a brain aneurysm rupture include the 
11
following: 
12
(A) Ellie Helton. On July 16, 2014, Ellie 
13
Helton, a vibrant, loving 14-year-old from Apex, 
14
North Carolina, passed away as a result of a 
15
ruptured aneurysm, stunning her parents, two 
16
sisters, and many, many loved ones. A day ear-
17
lier, on her second day of high school, she woke 
18
up with a terrible headache after a plum-sized 
19
aneurysm on her brain stem ruptured. While 
20
she suffered headaches throughout her life, she 
21
was never diagnosed. Ellie was an avid reader 
22
and excellent student, loved the arts, and was 
23
incredibly creative. She had an unwavering,

constant love for the family and friends in her 
1
life.

(B) Lisa Colagrossi. On March 20, 2015, 
3
Lisa Colagrossi—WABC Eyewitness News re-
4
porter, wife of 17 years, and mother of two 
5
sons—unexpectedly passed away at the age of 
6
49 years after suffering a massive ruptured 
7
brain aneurysm. Despite experiencing one of 
8
the classic warning signs of a brain aneurysm 
9
(the ‘‘worst headache of my life’’), Lisa’s pass-
10
ing came as a tremendous shock to her family 
11
and friends, who did not know what a brain an-
12
eurysm was, let alone its signs and symptoms. 
13
She is remembered for being a loving wife, a 
14
mother, and a successful reporter, and for her 
15
love of the New York Rangers. 
16
(C) Teresa Anne Lawrence, devoted moth-
17
er of three, beloved wife, and staple of her com-
18
munity, collapsed while visiting her son’s school 
19
on December 8, 1983. She had been struggling 
20
with and taking medication for hypertension for 
21
several years. At age 34, after being uncon-
22
scious for four days, she passed away as a re-
23
sult of a brain aneurysm. Her loving husband

and extended family were left to raise their chil-
1
dren, whom Teresa cherished so much. 
2
(D) Jennifer Sedney. On December 25, 
3
2013, Jennifer Sedney, a beautiful, accom-
4
plished young woman, passed away suddenly at 
5
the age of 27 from a ruptured brain aneurysm. 
6
Her only symptom was the ‘‘worst headache of 
7
her life’’, which none of her friends or family 
8
realized was a symptom of a potentially fatal 
9
condition. Jenny was a jogger, a disciplined ex-
10
erciser, and a successful health care consultant 
11
and had recently launched a health blog found-
12
ed on three principles—‘‘bee curious, bee radi-
13
ant, bee well’’. Her brother, mother, father, and 
14
a large devoted network of friends and relatives 
15
remember her every day. 
16
(4) The combined lost wages of survivors of 
17
brain aneurysm ruptures and their caretakers are 
18
approximately $138,000,000 per year. 
19
(5) Despite the widespread prevalence of this 
20
condition and the high societal cost it imposes on the 
21
Nation, the Federal Government only spends ap-
22
proximately $0.83 per year on brain aneurysm re-
23
search for each person afflicted with a brain aneu-
24
rysm.

(6) The first three iterations of the Inter-
1
national Study on Unruptured Intracranial Aneu-
2
rysms (ISUIA) have advanced researchers’ and clini-
3
cians’ understanding of how to most effectively man-
4
age and treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

(a) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—To con-
7
duct or support further comprehensive research on 
8
unruptured intracranial aneurysms, studying a broader 
9
patient population diversified by age, sex, and race, there 
10
is authorized to be appropriated to the National Institute 
11
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke $5,000,000 for each 
12
of fiscal years 2020 through 2024, to remain available

(b) SUPPLEMENT, NOT
SUPPLANT.—Any funds 
15

16
not supplant, other funding made available for research
