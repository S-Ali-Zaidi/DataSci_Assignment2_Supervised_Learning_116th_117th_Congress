RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Dominican Heritage 
Month. 
Whereas the House of Representatives is proud to recognize 
and commemorate Dominican Heritage Month, an ob-
servance that celebrates the contributions of Dominican- 
Americans; 
Whereas, in keeping with its time-honored traditions, we rec-
ognize and pay tribute to those who foster cultural pride 
and enhance the profile of diverse communities across the 
United States; 
Whereas since the initial wave of Dominican migration in the 
1960s to the most recent arrivals of today, Dominicans 
have worked hard to contribute to the national identity 
of the United States, educating people on their customs 
and enriching the quality of the Nation’s shared future;

Whereas the Dominican Republic enjoys a well-built relation-
ship with the United States on trade and investment that 
has expanded since the Dominican Republic-Central 
America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA– 
DR) entered into force on March 1, 2007; 
Whereas contributions from Dominican-Americans can be 
found in every facet of United States life, including fash-
ion designer Oscar de la Renta, Pulitzer Prize winner 
Junot Diaz, Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, and base-
ball giant David Ortiz, known as ‘‘Big Papi’’; 
Whereas many of the hemisphere’s first institutions were es-
tablished on the shores of the Dominican Republic, in-
cluding the first cathedral and the oldest university; 
Whereas Dominicans are freedom loving people who first 
began their campaign for their independence in 1831 
under the leadership of Juan Pablo Duarte, who formed 
a secret political military organization named La 
Trinitaria (The Trinity) that led to the end of the Hai-
tian occupation and transformed the Dominican Republic 
into an independent, self-sufficient nation; 
Whereas, after the long and hard fought campaign for free-
dom from Haiti, a ceremonial musket shot fired on Feb-
ruary 27, 1844, marked the Dominican Republic’s first 
official Independence Day; 
Whereas it is appropriate that the United States reserve the 
period between January 21 to February 27 to celebrate 
and honor Dominican heritage; 
Whereas it would be befitting to celebrate Dominican heritage 
beginning on January 21, The Day of the Procession of 
Altagracia, the Dominican Republic’s most important re-
ligious celebration;

Whereas it would also be befitting to end the period of Do-
minican heritage on February 27, the Dominican Repub-
lic’s Independence Day; 
Whereas it would give the Nation the opportunity to acknowl-
edge and applaud the economic, cultural, and social con-
tributions Dominican-Americans have made to the United 
States; and 
Whereas it would also give the Nation an opportunity to con-
sider the many Dominican achievements, on the island 
and in the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Dominican 
2
Heritage Month; 
3
(2) supports the establishment of a national 
4
month of Recognition for Dominican-Americans to

and

(3) urges the people of the United States to ob-
8
serve a national month of recognition for Domini-
9
can-Americans with appropriate ceremonies, pro-
10
grams, and activities.
