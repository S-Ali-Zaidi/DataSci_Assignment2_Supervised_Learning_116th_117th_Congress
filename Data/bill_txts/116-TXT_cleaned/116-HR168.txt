RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of March 6, 2019, as 
‘‘National Beauty and Wellness Education Day’’ by pro-
moting awareness of the goals and ideals of institutions 
of higher education that educate the Nation’s licensed 
beauty and wellness professionals. 
Whereas employment of— 
(1) barbers, hairstylists, and cosmetologists is pro-
jected to grow 13 percent from 2016 to 2026—faster 
than the average for all occupations and almost double 
the national average for all occupations of 7 percent as 
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(2) massage therapists is projected to grow 26 per-
cent from 2016 to 2026—much faster than the average

average for all occupations as reported by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics; and 
(3) skincare specialists (estheticians) is projected to 
grow 14 percent from 2016 to 2026—faster than average 
for all occupations and double the national average for all 
occupations of 7 percent as reported by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics; 
Whereas all States require barbers, hairstylists, cosmetolo-
gists, and skincare specialists to be licensed, and to qual-
ify for a license, candidates are required to graduate 
from a State-approved barber or cosmetology program 
and then pass a State-administered licensing exam; 
Whereas most States regulate massage therapy and require 
massage therapists to complete a postsecondary edu-
cation program of 500 or more hours of study and expe-
rience—in most cases leading to the candidate obtaining 
a license or certification; and 
Whereas, without proper education in health and safety re-
quirements, applied technical abilities, and acquired soft 
skills, individuals seeking to enter these in-demand occu-
pations would be unable to acquire the knowledge and 
proficiency required to successfully pass the required 
exam and enter the workforce: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of National 
2
Beauty and Wellness Education Day; 
3
(2) recognizes that population growth will lead 
4
to greater demand for beauty and wellness services; 
5
(3) understands that proper education is the 
6
key to ensuring that the expectations of the State,
