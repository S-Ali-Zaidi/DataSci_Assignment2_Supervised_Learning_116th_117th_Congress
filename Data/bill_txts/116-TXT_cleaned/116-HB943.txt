SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The United States has demonstrated a com-
3
mitment to remembrance and education about the 
4
Holocaust through bilateral relationships and en-
5
gagement in international organizations such as the 
6
United Nations (UN) and the International Holo-
7
caust Remembrance Association (IHRA); the United 
8
States works to promote Holocaust education as a 
9
means to understand the importance of democratic 
10
principles, use and abuse of power, and to raise 
11
awareness about the importance of genocide preven-
12
tion today. 
13
(2) The Congress has played a critical role in 
14
preserving the memory of the Holocaust and pro-
15
moting awareness, including by authorizing the 
16
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum as an 
17
independent establishment of the Federal Govern-
18
ment to ensure that ‘‘the study of the Holocaust be-
19
come part of the curriculum in every school system 
20
in the country’’, as well as by establishing a national 
21
Holocaust Remembrance Day in 1978. 
22
(3) The Congress has gone on record in support 
23
of expanded Holocaust education to increase aware-
24
ness about Holocaust history, counter prejudice and 
25
discrimination, and enhance efforts to teach its uni-
26

•HR 943 IH
versal lessons about human behavior and societal co-
1
hesion. 
2
(4) More than 70 years after the conclusion of 
3
World War II, with the decreasing number of eye-
4
witnesses and growing distance of students and their 
5
families from this history, it is important to institu-
6
tionalize education about the events of the Holocaust 
7
such as the Nazis’ racist ideology, propaganda, and 
8
plan to lead a state to war and, with their collabo-
9
rators, kill millions—including the systematic mur-
10
der of 6,000,000 Jewish people; as well as the perse-
11
cution and murder of millions of others in the name 
12
of racial purity, political, ideological, and behavioral 
13
grounds, among them Roma, the disabled, the Slavic 
14
people, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
15
and homosexuals. 
16
(5) As intolerance, antisemitism, bigotry, and 
17
all forms of hate are promoted by hate groups, Holo-
18
caust education provides a context in which to learn 
19
about the danger of what can happen when hate 
20
goes unchallenged and there is indifference in the 
21
face of the oppression of others; learning how and 
22
why the Holocaust happened is an important compo-
23
nent of the education of citizens of the United 
24
States.

(6) Today, those who deny that the Holocaust 
1
occurred or distort the true nature of the Holocaust 
2
continue to find forums, especially online; this denial 
3
and distortion dishonors those who were persecuted, 
4
and murdered, making it even more of a national 
5
imperative to educate students in the United States 
6
so that they may explore the lessons that the Holo-
7
caust provides for all people, sensitize communities 
8
to the circumstances that gave rise to the Holocaust, 
9
and help youth be less susceptible to the falsehood 
10
of Holocaust denial and distortion and to the de-
11
structive messages of hate that arise from Holocaust 
12
denial and distortion. 
13
(7) Currently, 8 States (California, Florida, Illi-
14
nois, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and 
15
Rhode Island) require by law that schools teach stu-
16
dents about the Holocaust; more schools and teach-
17
ers can and should deliver quality Holocaust edu-
18
cation. 
19
(8) While there are thriving professional devel-
20
opment programs across the United States delivered 
21
by Holocaust education centers, such as members of 
22
the Association of Holocaust Organizations, many 
23
students still have little exposure to education about 
24
the events of the Holocaust and its relevance to their

lives, in part due to the many financial and logistical 
1
barriers to getting resources from Holocaust edu-
2
cation centers to students in the classroom. 
3
(9) The Federal Government, especially the De-
4
partment of Education, has a role to play in pro-
5
moting resources and training that can assist teach-
6
ers and primary and secondary schools incorporate 
7
the study of the Holocaust into their curriculum, to 
8
help ensure that students have access to accurate 
9
and engaging historical information about the Holo-
10
caust, and the Department of Education is well-posi-
11
tioned to assist Holocaust education centers in over-
12
coming many of the barriers to expanding Holocaust 
13
education, which will allow more students to learn 
14
the lessons of the Holocaust.

18
ty’’ means—

in section 8101 of the Elementary and Sec-
21
ondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
22

U.S.C. 7171 et seq.); or 
3

4
tion 8101 of such Act (20 U.S.C. 7801)), that 
5
is independent of any local educational agency. 
6
(2) ANTISEMITISM.—The term ‘‘antisemitism’’ 
7
means a certain perception of Jews, which may be 
8
expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and

12
religious facilities. 
13
(3) HOLOCAUST.—The term ‘‘the Holocaust’’ 
14
means the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored 
15
persecution and murder of approximately 6,000,000 
16
Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. Dur-
17
ing the era of the Holocaust, German authorities 
18
also targeted other groups because of their perceived 
19
‘‘racial inferiority’’, such as Roma gypsies, the dis-
20
abled, and some of the Slavic people (Poles, Rus-
21
sians, and others). Other groups were persecuted on 
22
political, ideological, and behavioral grounds, among 
23
them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah’s Witnesses,

and homosexuals.
