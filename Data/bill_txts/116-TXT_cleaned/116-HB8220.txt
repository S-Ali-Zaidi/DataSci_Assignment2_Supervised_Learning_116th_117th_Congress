Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Learning Loss 
4
Assessment Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 8220 IH
(1) Before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (com-
1
monly referred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) pandemic began, 
2
258,000,000 children were out of school, including 
3
130,000,000 girls. 
4
(2) Students already at a disadvantage before 
5
COVID–19 will experience greater learning loss, 
6
thereby worsening inequity and inequality. 
7
(3) Approximately 90 percent of the world’s 
8
student population—over 1,700,000,000 children 
9
and youth—have had their education disrupted by 
10
school closure due to COVID–19. 
11
(4) School closures lead to interrupted learning, 
12
poor nutrition, gaps in childcare, increased dropout 
13
rates, exposure to violence, and social isolation. 
14
(5) Up to 9,700,000 children are at risk of 
15
dropping out of school permanently due to rising lev-
16
els of child poverty associated with the pandemic. 
17
(6) School closure and remote learning is espe-
18
cially burdensome on girls, who are frequently ex-
19
pected to shoulder more household chores and re-
20
sponsibilities, and are more vulnerable to gender- 
21
based violence. 
22
(7) During the Ebola epidemic, nationwide 
23
school closures in Sierra Leone in 2014 led to in-
24
creased instances of sexual- and gender-based vio-
25

lence, teenage pregnancy, school dropout, and child 
1
labor for girls. 
2
(8) Over 60 percent of national distance learn-
3
ing alternatives rely exclusively on online platforms 
4
but as many as 465,000,000 children and young 
5
people in these countries do not have access to the 
6
internet at home, with 80 percent of students in 
7
sub-Saharan Africa without such access, and an 
8
even higher rate for girls. 
9
(9) Distance learning tools are not always ac-
10
cessible to learners with disabilities or those with 
11
complex learning needs, especially in poorer and 
12
rural households. 
13
(10) Before the COVID–19 pandemic, refugee 
14
children were twice as likely to be out of school as 
15
other youth, and school closures and a lack of access 
16
to distance learning tools threaten to make the edu-
17
cation gap among refugee children even more severe. 
18
(11) The economic downturn caused by the 
19
COVID–19 pandemic could lead to an education fi-
20
nancing gap of $77,000,000,000 in low- and middle- 
21
income countries over the next two years. 
22
(12) The economic cost of school closures could 
23
be up to $1,337 per student, which on a global scale 
24

equates to approximately $10,000,000,000,000 in 
1
lost economic output over the coming generation. 
2
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
3
It is the policy of the United States that United 
4
States-funded basic education programs operating in for-
5
eign countries should— 
6
(1) provide inclusive learning opportunities for 
7
students and teachers, especially for the most 
8
marginalized, including girls and children with dis-
9
abilities; 
10
(2) build local capacity and help countries 
11
strengthen their education systems; 
12
(3) improve the delivery and quality of edu-
13
cation services; 
14
(4) improve equity and safety in education serv-
15
ices; and 
16
(5) support the return of children to school who 
17
have experienced interruptions in their education 
18
due to the COVID–19 pandemic and other causes.
