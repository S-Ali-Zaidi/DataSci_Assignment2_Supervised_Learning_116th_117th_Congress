SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Because of the importance of the goal that 
8
the bankruptcy system is self-funded, at no cost to 
9
the taxpayer, Congress has closely monitored the 
10

•HR 8895 IH
funding needs of the bankruptcy system, including 
1
by requiring periodic reporting by the Attorney Gen-
2
eral regarding the United States Trustee System 
3
Fund. 
4
(2) Congress has amended the various bank-
5
ruptcy fees as necessary to ensure that the bank-
6
ruptcy system remains self-supporting, while also 
7
fairly allocating the costs of the system among those 
8
who use the system. 
9
(3) Because the bankruptcy system is inter-
10
connected, the result has been a system of fees, in-
11
cluding filing fees, quarterly fees in chapter 11 
12
cases, and other fees, that together fund the courts, 
13
judges, United States trustees, and chapter 7 case 
14
trustees necessary for the bankruptcy system to 
15
function. 
16
(4) This Act and the amendments made by this 
17
Act— 
18
(A) ensure adequate funding of the United 
19
States trustees, supports the preservation of ex-
20
isting bankruptcy judgeships that are urgently 
21
needed to handle existing and anticipated in-
22
creases in business and consumer caseloads, 
23
and provides long-overdue additional compensa-
24
tion for chapter 7 case trustees whose caseloads 
25
16:11 Dec 19, 2020
H8895
3 
•HR 8895 IH
include chapter 11 reorganization cases that 
1
were converted to chapter 7 liquidation cases; 
2
and 
3
(B) confirm the longstanding intention of 
4
Congress that quarterly fee requirements re-
5
main consistent across all Federal judicial dis-
6
tricts. 
7
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act and the 
8
amendments made by this Act is to further the long-stand-
9
ing goal of Congress of ensuring that the bankruptcy sys-
10
tem is self-funded, at no cost to the taxpayer.
