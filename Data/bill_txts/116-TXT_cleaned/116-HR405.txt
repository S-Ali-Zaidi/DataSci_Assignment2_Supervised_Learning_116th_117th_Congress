efit of humankind and to establish the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (NASA); 
Whereas, in July of 1960, NASA announced the creation of 
the Apollo Program, the Nation’s first orchestrated ini-
tiative to ferry humankind out of Earth’s orbit and to the 
Moon; 
Whereas, on July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 Mission succeeded 
in landing the spacecraft Eagle on the surface of the 
Moon, piloted by two American astronauts, the first hu-
mans to ever make landfall on another celestial body; 
Whereas, on July 20 and 21, 1969, those brave Americans 
became the first humans to set foot on the surface of the 
Moon, forever changing Earth’s relationship with the 
heavens; 
Whereas this momentous event was watched in wonder by 
hundreds of millions of people back on Earth, including 
the hundreds of thousands of NASA civilian and military 
staff and partners who made the Apollo Program pos-
sible; 
Whereas the Apollo Program continued through December of 
1972 and spurred the greatest development of human sci-
entific and technological understanding of any decade to 
that point, leading to advances in rocketry, spaceflight, 
avionics, telecommunications, and computers, on which 
the American public still relies today; 
Whereas the National Air and Space Museum opened on the 
American Bicentennial in July 1976 as a birthday gift to 
the country in celebration of the Nation’s highest 
achievements, under the leadership and vision of Museum 
Director, NASA astronaut, and Apollo 11 Command 
Module Pilot Michael Collins;
