RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 150th anniversary of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service. 
Whereas, on February 9, 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant 
signed a Joint Resolution of Congress requiring the Sec-
retary of War to ‘‘provide for taking meteorological ob-
servations at the military stations in the interior of the 
continent, and at other points in the States and Terri-
tories . . . and for giving notice on the northern lakes and 
on the seacoast, by magnetic telegraph and marine sig-
nals, of the approach and force of storms’’ thereby cre-
ating the United States Army Signal Service’s Division of

ical responsibilities of the Signal Service to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and is thus known as the Weather 
Service’s first organic Act; 
Whereas the Weather Bureau began operations on July 1, 
1891; 
Whereas in response to the important role the Weather Bu-
reau played in the burgeoning aviation and commercial 
community, President Franklin D. Roosevelt transferred 
the Weather Bureau to the Department of Commerce in 
1940; 
Whereas with the enactment of the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the Weather Bureau was renamed the Na-
tional Weather Service and made a component of the new 
National 
Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 
Administration 
(NOAA) on October 5, 1970; 
Whereas with the enactment of the Weather Research and 
Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, and its partial reau-
thorization in 2019, Congress reaffirmed and emboldened 
the critical mission of NOAA’s National Weather Service, 
including the provision of impact-based decision support 
services to core partners; and 
Whereas, in 2020, the National Weather Service celebrates 
150 years protecting lives and property and enhancing 
the Nation’s economy, an enduring mission it retains to 
this day: Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
