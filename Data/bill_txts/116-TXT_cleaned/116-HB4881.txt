SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Traditionally, food standards of identity and 
3
composition have provided a framework for identi-
4
fying products and helping to ensure these products 
5
meet consumer expectations regarding composition 
6
and characteristics, as well as safety. 
7
(2) The legislative intent of standards of iden-
8
tity is to ensure product integrity and prevent eco-
9
nomic adulteration. Both consumers and industry 
10
have relied on the current system of standards since 
11
the enactment in 1938 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
12
and Cosmetic Act (in this section referred to as the 
13
‘‘FFDCA’’) (52 Stat. 1040). 
14
(3) The Federal Meat Inspection Act (in this 
15
section referred to as the ‘‘FMIA’’) grants the De-
16
partment of Agriculture (in this section referred to 
17
as the ‘‘USDA’’) sole regulatory authority over all 
18
meat and meat food products. 
19
(4) Section 1002 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
20
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 392) limits the regu-
21
latory authority of the Food and Drug Administra-
22
tion (in this section referred to as the ‘‘FDA’’) to 
23
all meat and meat food products not otherwise regu-
24
lated by the USDA under the Federal Meat Inspec-

tion Act, Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the 
1
Egg Products Inspection Act. 
2
(5) Both USDA and FDA are responsible for 
3
enforcing a universal standard that labels are truth-
4
ful and not misleading. 
5
(6) Several applicable terms are defined in law 
6
or regulation including— 
7
(A) the term ‘‘meat food product’’ defined 
8
in section 1 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act 
9
(21 U.S.C. 601); 
10
(B) the terms ‘‘meat’’, ‘‘meat broker’’, and 
11
‘‘meat byproduct’’ defined in section 301.2 of 
12
17 title 9, Code of Federal Regulations; 
13
(C) the term ‘‘beef’’ defined as the flesh of 
14
cattle in section 3 of the Beef Research and In-
15
formation Act (7 U.S.C. 2902); and 
16
(D) the term ‘‘beef products’’ defined as 
17
edible products produced in whole or in part 
18
from beef, exclusive of milk and milk products 
19
produced therefrom, in such section 3 (7 U.S.C. 
20
2902). 
21
(7) The definitions of ‘‘beef’’ and ‘‘beef prod-
22
ucts’’ were established under the Beef Research and 
23
Information Act for the purpose of strengthening 
24
the beef industry’s position in the marketplace and 
25

to maintain and expand domestic and foreign mar-
1
kets and uses for beef and beef products only. 
2
(8) The lack of any Federal definition of ‘‘beef’’ 
3
or ‘‘beef products’’ for the purposes of meat food 
4
product labeling has led some to begin marketing 
5
imitation products as meat or beef, creating the op-
6
portunity for marketplace confusion and consumer 
7
fraud that Congress originally charged the various 
8
Federal food regulatory agencies with the duty to 
9
prevent. 
10
(9) Imitation products labeled as beef or as beef 
11
products create confusion in the marketplace. These 
12
products are in direct violation of the ‘‘Congressional 
13
Findings and Declaration of Policy’’ authorized 
14
under section 2 of the Beef Research and Informa-
15
tion Act (7 U.S.C. 2901) and undermine the integ-
16
rity of that Act. 
17
SEC. 3. LABELING OF IMITATION MEAT PRODUCTS. 
18
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amend-
19
ed by inserting after section 403C of such Act (21 U.S.C. 
20
343–3) the following: 
21
‘‘SEC. 403D. LABELING OF IMITATION MEAT PRODUCTS. 
22
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding the provision of 
23
section 403(c), any imitation meat food product, beef, or 
24

label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the 
1
word ‘imitation’ immediately before or after the name of 
2
the food and a statement that clearly indicates the product 
3
is not derived from or does not contain meat. 
4
‘‘(b) COORDINATION WITH SECRETARY
OF AGRI-
5
CULTURE.— 
6
‘‘(1) NOTIFICATION OF MISBRANDING.—If the 
7
Secretary of Health and Human Services finds that 
8
food is misbranded under subsection (a), the Sec-
9
retary of Health and Human Services shall within 
10
60 days of such finding transmit a notice of such 
11
finding to the Secretary of Agriculture. 
12
‘‘(2) ENFORCEMENT
FAILURE.—If the Sec-
13
retary of Health and Human Services fails, within 
14
30 days of transmitting a notice under paragraph 
15
(1), to initiate an enforcement action, the Secretary 
16
of Agriculture may treat each such finding of mis-
17
branding under subsection (a) of this Act as a find-
18
ing of misbranding under section 1(n) of the Federal 
19
Meat Inspection Act. 
20
‘‘(c) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—This section shall 
21
not be construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary 
22
of Agriculture to take enforcement or other action under 
23
the Federal Meat Inspection Act or other applicable law.
