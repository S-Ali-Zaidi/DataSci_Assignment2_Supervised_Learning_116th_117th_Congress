Congress finds the following:

•HR 4979 IH
(1) The supply of STEM workers is not keeping 
1
pace with the rapidly evolving needs of the public 
2
and private sector, resulting in a deficit often re-
3
ferred to as a STEM skills shortage. 
4
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
5
tics, the United States will need one million addi-
6
tional STEM professionals than it is on track to 
7
produce in the coming decade. 
8
(3) Many STEM occupations offer higher 
9
wages, more opportunities for advancement, and a 
10
higher degree of job security than non-STEM jobs. 
11
(4) The 60,000,000 individuals in the United 
12
States who live in rural settings are significantly 
13
under-represented in STEM. 
14
(5) According to the National Center for Edu-
15
cation Statistics, nine million students in the United 
16
States—nearly 20 percent of the total K–12 popu-
17
lation—attend rural schools, and for reasons rang-
18
ing from teacher quality to shortages of resources, 
19
these students often have fewer opportunities for 
20
high-quality STEM learning than their peers in the 
21
Nation’s urban and suburban schools. 
22
(6) Rural areas represent one of the most 
23
promising, 
yet 
underutilized, 
opportunities 
for 
24
03:54 Nov 13, 2019
H4979

•HR 4979 IH
STEM education to impact workforce development 
1
and regional innovation, including agriculture. 
2
(7) The study of agriculture, food, and natural 
3
resources involves biology, engineering, physics, 
4
chemistry, math, geology, and other scientific fields. 
5
(8) More than 293,000,000 individuals in the 
6
United States use high-speed broadband to work, 
7
learn, access healthcare, and operate their busi-
8
nesses, while 19,000,000 individuals in the United 
9
States still lack access to high-speed broadband. 
10
Rural areas are hardest hit, with over 26 percent of 
11
individuals in rural areas in the United States lack-
12
ing access to high-speed broadband compared to 1.7 
13
percent of individuals in urban areas in the United 
14
States.
