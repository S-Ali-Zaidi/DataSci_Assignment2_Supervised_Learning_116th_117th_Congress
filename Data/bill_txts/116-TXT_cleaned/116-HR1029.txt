•HRES 1029 IH 
‘‘Additional Subpoena Enforcement Power 
1
‘‘7.(a)(1) Whenever any committee or subcommittee 
2
makes a written request to any department or agency of 
3
the Government, or to any individual, for the attendance 
4
of named witnesses or the production of such books, 
5
records, correspondence, memorandum, papers, docu-
6
ments, and electronic or digital files, data or information, 
7
in any form, including any electronic or digital files, data 
8
or information in any searchable formats in which they 
9
are available to or can be produced by the agency, as the 
10
committee or subcommittee considers necessary, a senior 
11
responsible official shall either comply with that request 
12
or file written objections within the time frame for re-
13
sponse set forth in the request. In the absence of a senior 
14
responsible official, the witness himself or herself is re-
15
sponsible for the duties that would otherwise have fallen 
16
on that official. 
17
‘‘(2) Nothing in this clause shall be interpreted as 
18
preventing a witness from asserting personal privileges re-
19
gardless of the decisions and actions of the senior respon-
20
sible official. 
21
‘‘(b) If the senior responsible official files written ob-
22
jections within the timeframe for response, the committee 
23
or subcommittee shall seek to resolve these objections 
24
through negotiation and accommodation. If a resolution 
25

•HRES 1029 IH 
cannot be reached, staff shall so certify to the chair of 
1
the committee. 
2
‘‘(c) If the senior responsible official fails to file ob-
3
jections or make available the designated witnesses or full 
4
production of responsive records and information within 
5
the timeframe for response, the chair of the committee 
6
may issue a subpoena to the senior responsible official for 
7
any unproduced records or information as to which no ob-
8
jection was filed, and to any designated witness to which 
9
no objection was filed. 
10
‘‘(d) With respect to any portion of the written re-
11
quest for documents and witnesses to which timely objec-
12
tion was made, a subpoena to the senior responsible offi-
13
cial and to designated witnesses, may be issued, following 
14
conclusion of the negotiations referred to in paragraph (b), 
15
by— 
16
‘‘(1) the chair, upon 48 hours notice to the 
17
ranking member, unless the ranking member objects 
18
during that period; or 
19
‘‘(2) a vote of the committee. 
20
‘‘(e) If the senior responsible official files written ob-
21
jections to a subpoena issued under paragraphs (c) or (d) 
22
within the timeframe for response, or the President per-
23
sonally and in writing asserts a claim of executive privilege

issue, the committee may hold a hearing to consider these 
1
objections. The senior responsible official shall personally 
2
attend this hearing but may not assert Executive Privilege 
3
on behalf of the President, and the committee chair may 
4
grant an exception for good cause shown. 
5
‘‘(f) If the committee overrules some or all of the ob-
6
jections asserted, it may issue an order of compliance 
7
which states the grounds for rejection of the objections, 
8
the date for compliance, and an advisement of the legal 
9
consequences of a failure to comply. 
10
‘‘(g) On the failure of the senior responsible official 
11
to comply with the order, the committee shall meet to as-
12
sess whether the noncompliance rises to the level of a 
13
breach of the constitutional privilege and duty of the 
14
House to be fully informed in order to properly perform 
15
its legislative responsibilities without undue obstruction 
16
and thereby warrants condemnation and punishment. If 
17
so, the committee shall report a privileged resolution of 
18
contempt. The accompanying report shall include a de-
19
tailed history and nature of the controversy and attempts 
20
at accommodation; the legal issues raised; the legislative 
21
need for the information sought; the legal and practical 
22
reasons for the determination that the objections were re-
23
jected; and the recommended monetary penalties.

‘‘(h) If the committee reports a resolution of con-
1
tempt, it shall be treated as a rule IX question of privilege 
2
of the House requiring precedence over all other questions 
3
until resolved and promptly scheduled for floor consider-
4
ation. The chair of the committee shall present the case 
5
for passage of the resolution. At the conclusion of the al-
6
lotted period for presentations, questions and debate, a 
7
vote on passage of the resolution (including any fine, if 
8
any). A proffer of an amendment to alter the rec-
9
ommended penalty is in order. 
10
‘‘(i)(1) Upon House passage of the resolution of con-
11
tempt the contemnor shall be assessed by the body an ini-
12
tial penalty of not more than $25,000 and total penalties 
13
of not more than $100,000. The amount of the ultimate 
14
penalty depends on timeliness of the contemnor’s compli-
15
ance in providing information withheld. The initial penalty 
16
of not more than $25,000 may be increased by increments 
17
of not more than $25,000 after a one-time waiting period 
18
of 20 calendar days from the initial penalty until the 
19
$100,000 maximum is reached. The 20-day period must 
20
only be observed after the first penalty. On House passage 
21
of the resolution of contempt, the General Counsel is au-
22
thorized to file an immediate suit for a judicial order to 
23
freeze the contemnor’s assets. On expiration of the 20- 
24
day period for compliance, the General Counsel is author-

ized to file suit for recovery of any accrued penalties, but

only if the contemnor has failed to comply with the sub-
2
poena before the end of such 20-day period. 
3
‘‘(2) No appropriated funds, funds provided from any 
4
accounts in the Treasury, funds derived from collection 
5
of fees, or other Government funds shall be used to pay 
6
a monetary penalty imposed by the House under this 
7
clause. 
8
‘‘(3) No person, group, entity, organization, or cor-
9
poration may make payments to, reimburse or offer remu-
10
neration of any kind to compensate a contemnor for, or 
11
assist a contemnor in paying, any portion of a monetary 
12
penalty imposed by the House. Nor shall any person, 
13
group, entity, organization, or corporation be permitted to 
14
pay any monetary penalties directly on behalf of a 
15
contemnor. The House may regard such actions to com-
16
pensate, reimburse or provide remunerations or payments 
17
to a contemnor as an obstruction of its investigative and 
18
information gathering prerogatives and responsibilities 
19
and a contempt of the House.

form as instructed by the committee or, in the ab-
9
sence of such instruction, shall be in the form that 
10
would be required by the rules and practice of the 
11
United States District for the District of Columbia.
