tions that are willing to work with the United States

in pursuit of shared objectives.

(2) The June 7, 2016, paragraph 17 of the 
3
India-United States Joint Statement entitled ‘‘The 
4
United States and India: Enduring Global Partners 
5
in the 21st Century’’, notes that the United States- 
6
India defense relationship can be an anchor of sta-
7
bility, and given the increasingly strengthened co-
8
operation in defense, the United States recognized 
9
India as a Major Defense Partner. 
10
(3) As such, the United States committed to 
11
continue to work toward facilitating technology shar-
12
ing with and transfer of advanced strategic military 
13
capability to India on a level commensurate with 
14
that of its closest allies and partners. The leaders of 
15
the two countries reached an understanding under 
16
which India would receive license-free access to a 
17
wide range of dual-use technologies in conjunction 
18
with steps that India has committed to take to ad-
19
vance its export control objectives. 
20
(4) As such, in support of India’s initiative to 
21
develop a domestic defense industrial capability and 
22
to support integration into the global supply chain, 
23
the United States committed to continuing to facili-
24
tate the export of goods and technologies, consistent

(5) Section 1292 of the National Defense Au-
4
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 
5
2751 note), relating to enhancing defense and secu-
6
rity cooperation with India, requests that the Sec-
7
retary of Defense and Secretary of State jointly take 
8
such actions as may be necessary to recognize In-
9
dia’s status as a major defense partner of the 
10
United States, consistent with the June 7, 2016, 
11
India-United States Joint Statement. 
12
(6) On July 30, 2018, Secretary of Commerce 
13
Wilbur Ross announced that India, because of its 
14
status as a major defense partner, would be moved 
15
to the Department of Commerce’s Strategic Trade 
16
Authorization Tier 1 license designation list which 
17
enables greater availability for exports and reexports 
18
to, and transfers within, India for articles under the 
19
Export Administration Regulations. In its final rule 
20
issued on August 3, 2018, the Department of Com-
21
merce’s Bureau of Industry and Security stated that 
22
the rule, which enabled India to be moved to the 
23
Tier 1 list, ‘‘befits India’s status as a Major Defense 
24
Partner’’.
