(1) The peoples of the United States and India 
1
have a long history of friendship and the interests

3
world will benefit from a stronger United States- 
4

6

7
social justice and social change, peace, and civil 
8
rights in their respective communities, and countries 
9
and in the world. 
10
(3) The use of nonviolent civil disobedience is a 
11
shared tactic that has played a key role in defeating 
12
social injustice in India, the United States, and in 
13
other parts of the world. 
14
(4) Mohandas Gandhi, who was born on Octo-
15
ber 2, 1869, was murdered on January 30, 1948,

(6) In February 1959, Dr. King and his wife, 
1
Coretta Scott King, traveled throughout India. By 
2
the end of his monthlong visit, Dr. King said, ‘‘I am 
3
more convinced than ever before that the method of 
4
nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon 
5
available to oppressed people in their struggle for 
6
justice and human dignity.’’. 
7
(7) Fifty years after Dr. King’s visit, All India 
8
Radio, the national radio station of India, discovered 
9
a taped message by Dr. King that emphasized the 
10
intellectual harmony between the messages of Dr. 
11
King and Mohandas Gandhi on nonviolent social ac-
12
tion. 
13
(8) On August 22, 2011, the Dr. Martin Lu-
14
ther King, Jr., National Memorial opened to the 
15
public in Washington, DC. This newest memorial on 
16
the National Mall pays tribute to Dr. King’s na-
17
tional and international contributions to world peace 
18
through nonviolent social change. 
19
(9) The year 2019 will mark the 150th birth 
20
anniversary of Mohandas Gandhi and the 90th birth 
21
anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
22
(10) Mohandas Gandhi, who employed the prin-

3
ciples was instrumental to the American civil rights

movement. 
5
(12) There is a long history of civil and social 
6
rights movements in the United States and in India. 
7
As the relationship between the United States and 
8
India evolves, a binational foundation through which 
9
the governments of each country can work together 
10
and catalyze private investment toward development 
11
objectives would provide an ongoing, productive in-
12
stitution and symbol of the friendship and common 
13
ideals of the respective governments and their peo-
14
ples. 
15
(13) There is a global goal of ending tuber-
16
culosis by 2030, the United States and India seek a 
17
TB-Free India by 2025, and the United States-India 
18
Gandhi-King Foundation will help address gaps 
19
across the TB value chain in prevention, detection, 
20
diagnosis, and treatment, and would catalyze mar-
21
ket-based strategies to bridge the service gap for the 
22
‘‘last mile’’. 
23

24
both major political parties have prioritized the
