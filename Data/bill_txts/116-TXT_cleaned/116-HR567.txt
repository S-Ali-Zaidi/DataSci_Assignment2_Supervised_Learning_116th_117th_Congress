RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of September 20, 2019, as 
‘‘National Concussion Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), otherwise 
known as a concussion, is an important health concern 
for children, teens, and adults; 
Whereas, according to information from the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention— 
(1) there are as many as 1,600,000 to 3,800,000 
sports-related concussions annually; 
(2) as many as 5,300,000 individuals live with a dis-
ability because of a traumatic brain injury (TBI);

(3) from 2001 to 2012, the rate of emergency de-
partment visits for sports- and recreation-related injuries 
involving a diagnosis of concussion or traumatic brain in-
jury, alone or in combination with other injuries, more 
than doubled among children 19 years of age or younger, 
and, in 2012, an estimated 329,290 children were treated 
in the United States for sports- and recreation-related in-
juries that included a diagnosis of concussion or trau-
matic brain injury; and 
(4) current data sources may only capture one out 
of every 9 concussions across the United States; 
Whereas the seriousness of concussions should not be mini-
mized in athletics, and return-to-play and return-to-learn 
protocols can help ensure recovery; 
Whereas concussions can affect physical, mental, and social 
health, and a greater awareness and understanding of 
proper diagnosis and management of concussions is crit-
ical to improved outcomes; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives can raise awareness 
about concussions among the medical community and the 
public by supporting the designation of September 20, 
2019, as ‘‘National Concussion Awareness Day’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Con-
2
cussion Awareness Day’’; 
3
(2) recognizes that mild traumatic brain injury 
4
(mTBI), otherwise known as a concussion, is an im-

portant health concern;
