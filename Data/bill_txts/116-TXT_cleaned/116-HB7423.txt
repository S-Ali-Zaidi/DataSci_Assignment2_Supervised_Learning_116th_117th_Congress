timately defeat an attempt by the People’s Republic 
1
of China to execute a fait accompli against Taiwan, 
2
resulting in— 
3
(A) the termination of hostilities or, at a 
4
minimum, the termination of the attempted fait 
5
accompli; or 
6
(B) the neutralization of the ability of the 
7
People’s Republic of China to execute a fait 
8
accompli against Taiwan. 
9
(2) FAIT ACCOMPLI.—The term ‘‘fait accompli’’ 
10
means the strategy of the People’s Republic of 
11
China designed to allow the People’s Republic of 
12
China to use military force to seize control of Tai-
13
wan before the United States Armed Forces are able 
14
to respond effectively, while simultaneously deterring 
15
an effective combined joint response by the United 
16
States Armed Forces by convincing the United 
17
States that mounting such a response would be pro-
18
hibitively difficult or costly.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
20
Congress makes the following findings: 
21
(1) Taiwan is— 
22
(A) a beacon of democracy in Asia; and 
23
04:11 Jul 23, 2020

•HR 7423 IH
(B) a steadfast partner of the United 
1
States in the common pursuit of a free and 
2
open Indo-Pacific region in which— 
3
(i) all societies enjoy sovereign auton-
4
omy; 
5
(ii) people live securely, prosperously, 
6
and with dignity; and 
7
(iii) the societies of the region rise 
8
and fall not by coercion but on the basis 
9
of peaceful competition. 
10
(2) If the Government of the People’s Republic 
11
of China were to use military force to compel the 
12
unification of Taiwan with the People’s Republic of 
13
China— 
14
(A) the world would lose one of the great 
15
champions of freedom and democracy; 
16
(B) the United States and allies and part-
17
ners of the United States would face severe dif-
18
ficulty in maintaining favorable balances of 
19
power relative to the People’s Republic of China 
20
in Northeast and Southeast Asia; and 
21
(C) as the balance of power in the Indo- 
22
Pacific region shifted in favor of the People’s 
23
Republic of China, the Government of the Peo-
24
04:11 Jul 23, 2020

•HR 7423 IH
ple’s Republic of China would possess an in-
1
creasing ability— 
2
(i) to impose its will throughout the 
3
Indo-Pacific region; and 
4
(ii) to prevent United States access to 
5
key trade routes and markets in the Indo- 
6
Pacific region, thereby imposing severe 
7
economic hardship on middle-class and 
8
working-class people of the United States 
9
and undermining the American way of life. 
10
(3) In January 2019, the Defense Intelligence 
11
Agency assessed that the ‘‘longstanding’’ intent of 
12
the Government of the People’s Republic of China to 
13
compel the unification of Taiwan with the People’s 
14
Republic of China, and deter any attempt by Taiwan 
15
to declare independence, was the ‘‘primary driver for 
16
China’s military modernization’’. 
17
(4) The Department of Defense Indo-Pacific 
18
Strategy Report released in June 2019, states that 
19
the Government of the People’s Republic of China is 
20
‘‘preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan with 
21
the mainland by force, while simultaneously deter-
22
ring, delaying, or denying any third-party interven-
23
tion on Taiwan’s behalf’’.

(5) Department of Defense statements and pub-
1
lications indicate that the Government of the Peo-
2
ple’s Republic of China is developing the plans and 
3
capabilities required to employ the fait accompli 
4
strategy to compel the unification of Taiwan with 
5
the People’s Republic of China, including— 
6
(A) the assessment by the Defense Science 
7
Board in 2017 that the Government of the Peo-
8
ple’s Republic of China had adopted a theory of 
9
victory whereby once conflict with the United 
10
States appeared inevitable, as might be the case 
11
if the Government of the People’s Republic of 
12
China attempted to use military force to compel 
13
the unification of Taiwan with the People’s Re-
14
public of China, then the Government of the 
15
People’s Republic of China ‘‘will attempt to 
16
achieve a decisive outcome very quickly, pre-
17
senting the United States and its allies with a 
18
fait accompli’’ and ‘‘then seek to demonstrate 
19
that the United States and its allies will incur 
20
significant costs in seeking to reverse that out-
21
come’’; 
22
(B) the assessment in the Indo-Pacific 
23
Strategy Report that, if the Government of the

People’s Republic of China or another compet-

itor in the Indo-Pacific region decides ‘‘to ad-
1
vance their interests through force, they are 
2
likely to enjoy a local military advantage at the 
3
onset of conflict. In a fait accompli scenario, 
4
competitors would seek to employ their capabili-
5
ties quickly to achieve limited objectives and 
6
forestall a response from the United States and 
7
its allies and partners’’; 
8
(C) testimony by then Acting Secretary of 
9
Defense Patrick Shanahan in March 2019 
10
that— 
11
(i) the Government of the People’s 
12
Republic of China ‘‘has made investments 
13
specifically intended to offset U.S. advan-
14
tages’’; and 
15
(ii) if deployed in the initial stages of 
16
a conflict, ‘‘these capabilities could seek to 
17
achieve a ‘fait accompli’ that would make 
18
reversing Chinese gains more difficult, 
19
militarily and politically’’; and 
20
(D) testimony by then Commanding Gen-
21
eral of Marine Corps Combat Development 
22
Command Lieutenant General David Berger in 
23
April 2019 that peer adversaries of the United 
24
04:11 Jul 23, 2020

•HR 7423 IH
States seek ‘‘to create strategic dilemmas 
1
through fait accompli scenarios’’. 
2
(6) In March 2019, then Acting Secretary of 
3
Defense Patrick Shanahan testified that the imple-
4
mentation of the 2018 National Defense Strategy 
5
would ensure the United States has ‘‘the capabili-
6
ties, posture, and employment of forces’’ required to 
7
prevent a fait accompli by the People’s Republic of 
8
China. 
9
(7) According to the Indo-Pacific Strategy Re-
10
port, ‘‘[t]he National Defense Strategy implicitly ac-
11
knowledges the most stressing potential scenarios 
12
will occur along our competitors’ peripheries’’. An 
13
attempted fait accompli by the People’s Republic of 
14
China against Taiwan should therefore be expected 
15
to constitute a ‘‘most stressing’’ potential scenario 
16
for the United States Armed Forces. 
17
(8) The National Defense Strategy Commission 
18
found that the United States Armed Forces must be 
19
postured ‘‘to deter and prevent a fait accompli by an 
20
agile opportunistic adversary’’ in order to compete 
21
effectively in the Indo-Pacific region and stated that 
22
‘‘the United States must develop new operational 
23
concepts to achieve strategic advantage, including by 
24
addressing the ability of aggressive regimes to

04:11 Jul 23, 2020

•HR 7423 IH
achieve a fait accompli against states on their pe-
1
riphery,’’ in recognition of— 
2
(A) the unique challenges to the United 
3
States Armed Forces posed by the employment 
4
of the fait accompli strategy by the Government 
5
of the People’s Republic of China or another 
6
strategic competitor; and 
7
(B) the consequent urgent need for new 
8
thinking and steady focus by the Department of 
9
Defense on ensuring the ability of the United 
10
States Armed Forces to prevent an adversary 
11
from using the fait accompli strategy to ad-
12
vance its interests at the expense of those of the 
13
United States. 
14
(9) Department of Defense strategic guidance 
15
and official statements underscore the essential role 
16
that denial operations will play in preventing a fait 
17
accompli by the People’s Republic of China against 
18
Taiwan, including— 
19
(A) the incorporation in the National De-
20
fense Strategy of the Global Operating Model 
21
that includes a ‘‘blunt layer’’ of combat-credible 
22
forward forces postured and employed to 
23
‘‘delay, degrade, or deny adversary aggression’’; 
24
04:11 Jul 23, 2020
H7423

•HR 7423 IH
(B) the conclusion by the National Defense 
1
Strategy Commission that the Department of 
2
Defense must position ‘‘substantial capability 
3
forward’’ in the form of the ‘‘blunt layer’’ in-
4
cluded in the Global Operating Model to ‘‘deter 
5
and prevent a fait accompli’’; 
6
(C) the statement for the record by the 
7
Commander of the United States Indo-Pacific 
8
Command, Admiral Phil Davidson, in April 
9
2018 in which he concludes, ‘‘[d]ue to the dis-
10
tances involved in the Indo-Pacific, we cannot 
11
rely solely on surge forces from the continental 
12
United States to deter Chinese aggression or 
13
prevent a fait accompli. PACOM must maintain 
14
a robust blunt layer that effectively deters Chi-
15
nese aggression in the Indo-Pacific’’; 
16
(D) the Joint Operating Concept for De-
17
terrence Operations, which states that forward- 
18
deployed forces, such as those included in the 
19
blunt layer of the Global Operating Model and 
20
referenced by the National Defense Strategy 
21
Commission and the Commander of the United 
22
States Indo-Pacific Command, contribute to 
23
‘‘denying benefits’’ and thereby reduce ‘‘the

1
sary decisionmakers from concluding they 
2
might achieve a military fait accompli that 
3
could be extremely costly for the [United 
4
States] to reverse by force’’; 
5
(E) the United States Army Multi-Domain 
6
Operations concept document, which states that 
7
the Armed Forces must demonstrate the capa-
8
bility ‘‘to immediately deny a fait accompli at-
9
tack’’ in order to deter a near-peer adversary; 
10
and 
11
(F) the Marine Corps Force Design 2030 
12
report, which states that forward-deployed 
13
forces ‘‘that can continue to operate inside an 
14
adversary’s long-range precision-fire weapons 
15
engagement zone (WEZ) are more operationally 
16
relevant than forces which must rapidly maneu-
17
ver to positions outside the WEZ in order to re-
18
main survivable,’’ and that such ‘‘stand-in’’ 
19
forces possess the capability to ‘‘attrite adver-
20
sary forces, enable joint force access require-
21
ments, complicate targeting and consume adver-
22
sary [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnais-
23
sance] resources, and prevent fait accompli sce-

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the ability of the United States to uphold 
3
a free and open Indo-Pacific region would be se-
4
verely compromised if the Government of the Peo-
5
ple’s Republic of China were able to compel the uni-
6
fication of Taiwan with the People’s Republic of 
7
China, particularly if the People’s Republic of China 
8
were able to do so by military force; 
9
(2) the loss by the United States of the ability 
10
to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific region 
11
would result in the significantly increased vulner-
12
ability of the middle-class and working-class people 
13
of the United States and the allies and partners of 
14
the United States to economic coercion by the Gov-
15
ernment of the People’s Republic of China; 
16
(3) the fate of Taiwan is therefore crucially 
17
linked to the fates of all countries in the Indo-Pa-
18
cific region, including to the fate of the United 
19
States; 
20
(4) under the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 
21
3301 et seq.), it is the policy of the United States 
22
to consider any effort to determine the future of 
23
Taiwan by other than peaceful means to be of grave 
24
concern to the United States; 
25
04:11 Jul 23, 2020

•HR 7423 IH
(5) since 1979, the United States Government 
1
has consistently upheld the commitments of the 
2
United States under the Taiwan Relations Act (22 
3
U.S.C. 3301 et seq.); 
4
(6) the National Defense Authorization Act for 
5
Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92) reaffirms 
6
that the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et 
7
seq.) and the ‘‘Six Assurances’’ are the cornerstones 
8
of United States relations with Taiwan; 
9
(7) the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 
10
et seq.) further establishes the policy of the United 
11
States ‘‘to maintain the capacity of the United 
12
States to resist any resort to force or other forms 
13
of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the 
14
social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan’’; 
15
(8) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
16
China appears to be developing the plans and capa-
17
bilities required to use the fait accompli strategy to 
18
compel the unification of Taiwan with the People’s 
19
Republic of China, thereby jeopardizing the security 
20
and the social and economic system of the people of 
21
Taiwan; 
22
(9) denial operations will have an essential role 
23
in any strategy to prevent a fait accompli by the 
24
People’s Republic of China against Taiwan; and
