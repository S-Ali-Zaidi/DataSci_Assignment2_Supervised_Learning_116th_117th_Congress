•HR 2262 IH
(1) The environmental health workforce is vital 
1
to protecting the health and safety of the public. 
2
(2) For years, State and local governmental 
3
public health agencies have reported substantial 
4
workforce losses and other challenges to the environ-
5
mental health workforce. 
6
(3) According to the Association of State and 
7
Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) and the Na-
8
tional Association of County and City Health Offi-
9
cials (NACCHO), more than 50,600 State and local 
10
environmental health workforce jobs have been lost 
11
since 2008. This represents approximately 22 per-
12
cent of the total State and local environmental 
13
health workforce. 
14
(4) In the coming years, the retiring Baby 
15
Boomer Generation will lead to a further decrease in 
16
the environmental health workforce. 
17
(5) Currently, only 28 States require a creden-
18
tial for environmental health workers that is an im-
19
partial, third-party endorsement of an individual’s 
20
professional knowledge and experience. 
21
(6) Educating and training existing and new 
22
environmental health professionals should be a na-
23
tional public health goal.
