SEC. 8. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RURAL AMERICA. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The founders realized the fundamental im-
3
portance of property rights when they codified the 
4
Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Con-
5
stitution, which requires that private property shall 
6
not be taken ‘‘for public use, without just compensa-
7
tion’’. 
8
(2) Rural lands are unique in that they are not 
9
traditionally considered high tax revenue-generating 
10
properties for State and local governments. In addi-
11
tion, farmland and forest land owners need to have 
12
long-term certainty regarding their property rights 
13
in order to make the investment decisions to commit 
14
land to these uses. 
15
(3) Ownership rights in rural land are funda-
16
mental building blocks for our Nation’s agriculture 
17
industry, which continues to be one of the most im-
18
portant economic sectors of our economy. 
19
(4) In the wake of the Supreme Court’s deci-
20
sion in Kelo v. City of New London, abuse of emi-
21
nent domain is a threat to the property rights of all 
22
private property owners, including rural land own-
23
ers. 
24
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
25
gress that the use of eminent domain for the purpose of 
26
02:44 Feb 01, 2019
H738
11 
•HR 738 IH
economic development is a threat to agricultural and other 
1
property in rural America and that the Congress should 
2
protect the property rights of Americans, including those 
3
who reside in rural areas. Property rights are central to 
4
liberty in this country and to our economy. The use of 
5
eminent domain to take farmland and other rural property 
6
for economic development threatens liberty, rural econo-
7
mies, and the economy of the United States. The taking 
8
of farmland and rural property will have a direct impact 
9
on existing irrigation and reclamation projects. Further-
10
more, the use of eminent domain to take rural private 
11
property for private commercial uses will force increasing 
12
numbers of activities from private property onto this Na-
13
tion’s public lands, including its National forests, National 
14
parks and wildlife refuges. This increase can overburden 
15
the infrastructure of these lands, reducing the enjoyment 
16
of such lands for all citizens. Americans should not have 
17
to fear the government’s taking their homes, farms, or 
18
businesses to give to other persons. Governments should 
19
not abuse the power of eminent domain to force rural 
20
property owners from their land in order to develop rural 
21
land into industrial and commercial property. Congress 
22
has a duty to protect the property rights of rural Ameri-
23
cans in the face of eminent domain abuse.

SEC. 9. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the policy of the United States to encourage, 
2
support, and promote the private ownership of property 
3
and to ensure that the constitutional and other legal rights 
4
of private property owners are protected by the Federal 
5
Government.

SEC. 10. RELIGIOUS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. 
7
(a) PROHIBITION ON STATES.—No State or political 
8
subdivision of a State shall exercise its power of eminent 
9
domain, or allow the exercise of such power by any person 
10
or entity to which such power has been delegated, over 
11
property of a religious or other nonprofit organization by 
12
reason of the nonprofit or tax-exempt status of such orga-
13
nization, or any quality related thereto if that State or 
14
political subdivision receives Federal economic develop-
15
ment funds during any fiscal year in which it does so. 
16
(b) INELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL FUNDS.—A viola-
17
tion of subsection (a) by a State or political subdivision 
18
shall render such State or political subdivision ineligible 
19
for any Federal economic development funds for a period 
20
of 2 fiscal years following a final judgment on the merits 
21
by a court of competent jurisdiction that such subsection 
22
has been violated, and any Federal agency charged with 
23
distributing those funds shall withhold them for such 2- 
24
year period, and any such funds distributed to such State 
25
or political subdivision shall be returned or reimbursed by 
26

such State or political subdivision to the appropriate Fed-

eral agency or authority of the Federal Government, or

component thereof.

(c) PROHIBITION ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.—The 
4
Federal Government or any authority of the Federal Gov-
5
ernment shall not exercise its power of eminent domain

over property of a religious or other nonprofit organization 
7
by reason of the nonprofit or tax-exempt status of such 
8
organization, or any quality related thereto.

10
AND PROCEDURES RELATING TO EMINENT

ment of this Act, the head of each Executive department

16
of that department or agency to bring its rules, regula-

SEC. 12. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
19
It is the sense of Congress that any and all pre-
20
cautions shall be taken by the government to avoid the

unfair or unreasonable taking of property away from sur-
22
vivors of Hurricane Katrina who own, were bequeathed, 
23
or assigned such property, for economic development pur-
24
