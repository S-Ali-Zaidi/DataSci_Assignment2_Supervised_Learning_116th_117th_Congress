A BILL 
To improve the fielding of newest generations of personal 
protective equipment to the Armed Forces, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Body Armor for Fe-
4
males Modernization Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
7
ings:

H5491
2 
•HR 5491 IH
(1) Ill-fitting personal protective equipment 
1
(PPE) for members of the Armed Forces impedes 
2
performance and lethality by reducing range of mo-
3
tion, speed, and agility, and can interfere with the 
4
aim of shoulder-braced weapons. 
5
(2) Access to female-specific personal protective 
6
equipment, or smaller-sized unisex personal protec-
7
tive equipment, has traditionally been limited. Such 
8
equipment has typically been provided only to some 
9
deploying members of the Armed Forces, but not to 
10
those going through initial entry training (IET), or 
11
for regular unit training events. 
12
(3) Members of the Armed Force need to be fa-
13
miliarized with and train in their combat gear before 
14
deploying in order to be fully prepared and mission 
15
capable. 
16
(4) Research shows that poorly fitting personal 
17
protective equipment is a leading cause of prevent-
18
able injury for all members of the Armed Forces, 
19
whether deployed or in training. 
20
(5) Studies on operational physical performance 
21
and fitness in female members of the Armed Forces 
22
suggest that the best way to decrease the likelihood 
23
of injury is through consistent physical training with

equipment that mirrors that which is used in a com-
1
bat environment. 
2
(6) Properly fitting personal protective equip-
3
ment for training and deployment will assist in the 
4
gender-integration process in the Armed Forces as 
5
well as improve overall combat effectiveness, while 
6
simultaneously bringing about a reduction in inju-
7
ries. 
8
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
9
gress— 
10
(1) that committed resources for new genera-
11
tion personal protective equipment for female 
12
warfighters is essential to their warfighting readi-
13
ness; 
14
(2) to encourage the Armed Forces to expedite 
15
contracting for and procurement and fielding of new 
16
generation personal protective equipment that better 
17
fits and protects all members of the Armed Forces, 
18
including female members, and reduces preventable 
19
injuries; and 
20
(3) to encourage collaboration between the 
21
Armed Forces, academia, and industry on the use of 
22
emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence 
23
(AI), human factors modeling, and digital predictive 
24
human modeling, in the development of next genera-
