RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of July 2019 as Uterine Fibroids 
Awareness Month. 
Whereas fibroids may cause significant morbidity through 
their presence in the uterus and pelvic cavity, causing 
significant pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, repro-
ductive dysfunction, miscarriages, and even infertility; 
Whereas the pain, discomfort, stress, and other physical and 
emotional symptoms of living with fibroids may signifi-
cantly interfere with a woman’s quality of life, compro-
mising her ability to function normally or work or care 
for her family, and may lead to more severe health and 
wellness issues; 
Whereas uterine fibroids are the most prevalent medical con-
dition affecting women, with an estimated 30 percent of

women developing a uterine fibroid by age 35, and 80 
percent of women developing a uterine fibroid by age 50; 
Whereas the exact number of affected women is unknown, as 
detection and diagnosis is difficult because only 1 out of 
4 women who have a uterine fibroid tumor exhibit symp-
toms severe enough to require treatment; 
Whereas the overall incidence of uterine fibroid tumors is es-
timated to disproportionately and more severely impact 
Black and Hispanic women, resulting in an incidence rate 
that is 3 times greater in women with Black ancestry and 
2 times greater in Hispanic women compared to Cauca-
sian women; 
Whereas a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is among 
the most common surgical treatments for uterine 
fibroids, and more than 200,000 hysterectomies are per-
formed each year to treat uterine fibroids, at an esti-
mated annual cost of more than $2 billion; 
Whereas uterine fibroid tumors were estimated to cost the 
United States $5.9 billion to $34.4 billion annually with 
an estimated annual lost work cost of $1.6 billion to 
$17.2 billion through absenteeism and short-term dis-
ability in women ages 25 to 54; and 
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on uter-
ine fibroids prevention, screening, and symptoms are held 
during the month of July each year: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
