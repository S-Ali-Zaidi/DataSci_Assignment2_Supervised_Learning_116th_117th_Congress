SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID–19 Health 
2
Care Worker Protection Act of 2020’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The infectious disease COVID–19 presents 
6
a grave danger to health care workers who are the 
7
first line of defense of the United States against this 
8
epidemic. 
9
(2) Hundreds of health care workers in the 
10
United States have been infected or quarantined due 
11
to exposure to patients with COVID–19. Surveys 
12
conducted by health care worker unions and others 
13
have found that many health care facilities are inad-
14
equately prepared to safely protect health care work-
15
ers who are exposed to the virus. 
16
(3) Inadequate infection control precautions 
17
have a detrimental impact on health care workers, 
18
patients and the public, and if there is breakdown in 
19
health care worker protections, the Nation’s public 
20
health system is placed at risk. 
21
(4) The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
22
(hereinafter referred to as ‘‘SARS’’) epidemic of 
23
2003 and 2004 in Canada, which involved a 
24
coronavirus, resulted in a disproportionately large 
25
number of infections of both health care workers and 
26

patients in Ontario, Canada, hospitals due to insuffi-
1
cient infection control procedures involving SARS. 
2
(5) The Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
3
ministration began rulemaking on a standard to pro-
4
tect health care workers from airborne and other in-
5
fectious diseases in 2009. In 2017, the Trump Ad-
6
ministration suspended work on this rulemaking, re-
7
moving it from the active Regulatory Agenda. 
8
(6) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
9
vention issued a document entitled, ‘‘2007 Guideline 
10
for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission 
11
of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings’’ in July, 
12
2007. However, the guideline in such document is 
13
not binding. 
14
(7) Absent an enforceable standard, employers 
15
lack mandatory requirements to implement an effec-
16
tive and ongoing infection and exposure control pro-
17
gram that provides protection to health care workers 
18
from COVID–19. 
19
(8) Section 6(c)(1) of the Occupational Safety 
20
and Health Act authorizes the Occupational Safety 
21
and Health Administration to issue an ‘‘Emergency 
22
Temporary Standard’’ if employees are exposed to 
23
grave danger from harmful agents or new hazards 
24
and if an emergency standard is necessary to protect 
25

•HR 6139 IH
employees from such danger. The widespread out-
1
break of COVID–19 clearly satisfies these two condi-
2
tions. 
3
(9) The Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
4
ministration has received two petitions in March 
5
2020 calling on the Occupational Safety and Health 
6
Administration to issue an Emergency Temporary 
7
Standard to protect workers from COVID–19. 
8
(10) An Emergency Temporary Standard is 
9
necessary to ensure the immediate protection of 
10
workers in health care workplaces and other high- 
11
risk workplaces identified by the Centers for Disease 
12
Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety 
13
and Health Administration from infection related to 
14
COVID–19.
