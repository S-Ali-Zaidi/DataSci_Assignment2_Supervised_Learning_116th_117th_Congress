RESOLUTION 
Resolution to end the inquisition of President Donald J. 
Trump. 
Whereas the Constitution of the United States exclusively 
vests the power to initiate impeachment with the House 
of Representatives; 
Whereas the Jefferson Manual explicitly states how impeach-
ment proceedings may begin; 
Whereas during previous impeachment efforts, the House of 
Representatives explicitly authorized, per adopted Rules 
of the House of Representatives and longstanding House 
procedure, impeachment proceedings; 
Whereas, on July 17, 2019, the House of Representatives 
voted on House Resolution 498, impeaching Donald John 
Trump, President of the United States, of high mis-
demeanors; during that vote, the Resolution failed to pass

the House of Representatives as only 95 out of 234 
Democrats supported impeaching President Trump; 
Whereas the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of 
Representatives has perpetuated a tangential inquisition 
after the failure of House Resolution 498; 
Whereas, on August 8, 2019, Committee on the Judiciary 
Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated the Committee is under-
taking an investigation of ‘‘all the evidence’’ and ‘‘will at 
the conclusion of this, hopefully by the end of the year 
vote articles of impeachment to the House floor or we 
won’t’’; 
Whereas, on September 16, 2019, Committee on the Judici-
ary Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated the Committee is 
‘‘impeaching the president right now’’; 
Whereas the impeachment of President Trump has not been 
authorized by the House of Representatives; 
Whereas Representative Nadler is leading a biased, pre-deter-
mined impeachment effort of the president as opposed to 
executing his investigative duties and is unfit to serve as 
Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary of the 
House of Representatives; 
Whereas the current actions of the Committee on the Judici-
ary of the House of Representatives regarding impeach-
ment are being conducted in violation of established 
House Rules, practices and principles as made evident 
from Chairman Nadler’s admissions; and 
Whereas clause two of Rule XXIII of the Rules of the House 
of Representatives provides, ‘‘A Member . . . of the 
House shall adhere to the spirit and the letter of the 
Rules of the House and to the rules of duly constituted 
committees thereof’’: Now, therefore, be it
