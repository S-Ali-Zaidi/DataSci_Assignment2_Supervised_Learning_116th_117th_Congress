SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Despite the pivotal role police officers play 
3
in preventing and controlling crime, there are sig-
4
nificant gaps in research on the fairness and efficacy 
5
of policing policies and practices, including those re-
6
lated to use of force. 
7
(2) The lack of accurate and comprehensive 
8
data on police use of force is often cited as one of 
9
the most significant barriers to identifying and un-
10
derstanding patterns of police use of excessive force 
11
against civilians. 
12
(3) The best available evidence reveals in-
13
creased likelihood of police use of force against peo-
14
ple of color, people with disabilities, LGBT people, 
15
people with mental health conditions, people with 
16
low incomes, and those at the intersections of these 
17
groups. 
18
(4) Biases in advanced policing technologies, in-
19
cluding biometric identification systems, have the po-
20
tential to exacerbate such disparities. 
21
(5) Along with better data, more social and be-
22
havioral research is needed to improve our under-
23
standing of the potential factors that influence ex-
24
cessive use of force as well as the related psycho-
