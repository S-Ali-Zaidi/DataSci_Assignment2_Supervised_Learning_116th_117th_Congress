A BILL 
To prohibit the research and development, production, and 
deployment of the Trident D5 low-yield nuclear warhead, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hold the Low-Yield 
4
Nuclear Explosive Act’’ or the ‘‘Hold the LYNE Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 1086 IH
(1) The United States has an unparalleled nu-
1
clear arsenal, including 1,350 strategic nuclear war-
2
heads deployed on intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
3
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and strategic 
4
bombers. 
5
(2) A new low-yield nuclear weapon to be car-
6
ried on a ballistic missile submarine risks lowering 
7
the threshold for nuclear use and increasing the 
8
chance of miscalculation that could escalate into all- 
9
out nuclear exchange. 
10
(3) When launched, such a low-yield nuclear 
11
warhead would be indistinguishable to an adversary 
12
from the high-yield W76 and W88 submarine- 
13
launched warheads. 
14
(4) On January 25, 2018, former Secretary of 
15
State George Schultz testified before the Committee 
16
on Armed Services of the Senate that ‘‘A nuclear 
17
weapon is a nuclear weapon. You use a small one, 
18
[and] then you go to a bigger one. I think nuclear 
19
weapons are nuclear weapons and we need to draw 
20
the line there.’’. 
21
(5) Former Senator Sam Nunn and former Sec-
22
retary of Energy Ernest Moniz stated in an op-ed on 
23
February 1, 2018, that, ‘‘The most immediate pri-
24
ority should be to structure and posture U.S. and

•HR 1086 IH
Russian nuclear forces to deter nuclear use and re-
1
duce the risk of an accidental, mistaken or unau-
2
thorized launch. Against this backdrop, the current 
3
Russian concept of ‘escalate to de-escalate’—i.e., 
4
limited nuclear use designed to create a pause in the 
5
conflict and open a pathway for a negotiated settle-
6
ment on Moscow’s terms—and U.S. calls for more 
7
‘usable’ nuclear weapons taken together make the 
8
world a vastly more dangerous place.’’. 
9
(6) The ballistic missile submarines of the 
10
United States have never carried low-yield nuclear 
11
warheads, and setting a historical precedent could 
12
undermine the unique and paramount role of bal-
13
listic-missile submarines as the assured, survivable 
14
second-strike capability of the United States to deter 
15
large-scale nuclear war. 
16
(7) The United States should reject policies 
17
that increase the likelihood of nuclear war and weak-
18
en national security, including investments in low- 
19
yield nuclear weapons.

thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–

law amended by such section are restored as if such sec-
11
tion had not been enacted.
