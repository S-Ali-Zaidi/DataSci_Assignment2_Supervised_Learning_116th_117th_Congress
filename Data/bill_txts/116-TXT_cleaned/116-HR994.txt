RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives con-
demning threats to Hong Kong’s freedoms and autonomy 
on the 31st anniversary of the violent repression of the 
peaceful protests centered in Beijing’s Tiananmen 
Square. 
Whereas the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square mas-
sacre is an especially poignant milestone, particularly as 
the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region of the People’s Republic of China (‘‘Hong Kong’’) 
and freedoms guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong are 
currently under threat by possible national security legis-
lation from the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China (‘‘China’’);

Whereas, during the spring of 1989, an estimated 1,000,000 
people engaged in Tiananmen Square protests and citi-
zens in over 400 Chinese cities staged similar protests, 
including among many others, students, workers, aca-
demics, journalists and government employees; 
Whereas the peaceful demonstrations of 1989 called upon the 
Government of China to eliminate corruption, accelerate 
economic and political reform, and protect human rights, 
particularly the freedoms of expression and assembly, 
issues that remain relevant in United States-China rela-
tions 31 years later; 
Whereas, on June 4, 1989, troops of the People’s Liberation 
Army, at the behest of Chinese Communist Party leader-
ship, attacked Tiananmen Square to repress demonstra-
tors, crushing defenseless protestors with tanks and fir-
ing on them indiscriminately, killing hundreds or possibly 
thousands of individuals; 
Whereas, since June 4, 1989, the Government of China cen-
sors information about the Tiananmen Square protests in 
1989 and imprisons and harasses its own citizens who at-
tempt to discuss or commemorate Tiananmen Square 
protests and their violent suppression; 
Whereas, the Tiananmen Mothers—a group in China com-
posed of parents and family members of individuals killed 
on or around June 4, 1989, have annually called upon 
the Government of China to reveal the truth of the 
events; 
Whereas people of mainland China and Macau are again 
barred this year from commemorating the lives lost and 
the legacy of the 1989 massacre;

•HRES 994 IH 
Whereas, the Government of China continues to view the de-
mands of the Tiananmen protesters, including democ-
racy, transparency, rights protections, and freedom of 
speech, as threats to the legitimacy of the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s hold on political power; 
Whereas the people of Hong Kong have commemorated the 
Tiananmen massacre each year faithfully in large num-
bers; 
Whereas the Hong Kong Police Force has refused to author-
ize the annual candlelight vigil to commemorate 
Tiananmen this year; 
Whereas Hong Kong’s guaranteed freedoms and the rule of 
law have allowed it to be a prosperous bridge between 
mainland China and the world; 
Whereas Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms have been 
eroded by the actions of the Government of Hong Kong 
and the Government of China, particularly over the past 
several years, with disqualifications of elected members of 
Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, blocking citizens from 
running for office, failing to address the petitions of the 
Hong Kong people, banning a political party advocating 
Hong Kong independence, and failing to address police 
excessive use of force; 
Whereas, the political turmoil in Hong Kong is primarily the 
result of actions of the Government of Hong Kong and 
the Government of China and their failure to accommo-
date or recognize the lawful desire of the people of Hong 
Kong for preserving their autonomy and democratic 
rights and privileges, including selection of the chief exec-
utive by universal suffrage as provided for in the Basic 
Law and the Joint Declaration of the Government of the

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on 
the Question of Hong Kong, done at Beijing on Decem-
ber 19, 1984 (the ‘‘Joint Declaration’’); 
Whereas the arbitrary arrests of peaceful protesters, includ-
ing well-known democracy advocates such as Martin Lee, 
Jimmy Lai, Lee Cheuk Yan, Margaret Ng, Albert Ho, 
Leung Kwok-hung, Au Nok-hin, Figo Chan, and others, 
is reminiscent of the treatment of peaceful protestors in 
mainland China by the Government of China; 
Whereas China’s National People’s Congress has decided to 
impose national security legislation with respect to Hong 
Kong; 
Whereas the implementation of that legislation signals a vio-
lation of China’s commitment to the people of Hong 
Kong to honor ‘‘one country, two systems’’, a severe blow 
to Hong Kong’s autonomy and a violation of the Joint 
Declaration; 
Whereas the United States Secretary of State, pursuant to 
the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public 
Law 102–383), has determined that Hong Kong no 
longer manifests a ‘‘high degree of autonomy’’ distinct 
from mainland China; 
Whereas national security laws are used widely in mainland 
China to imprison or arbitrarily detain dissidents, rights 
defenders, civil society advocates, religious leaders and 
adherents, and persons from ethnic minorities; 
Whereas human rights, democracy, and religious freedom ad-
vocates have been imprisoned or arbitrarily detained 
under national security laws in mainland China, including 
Wu Gan, Qin Yongmin, Zhou Shifeng, Yu Wensheng,

Wang Yi, and Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in 
state custody nearly three years ago; 
Whereas the United States Congress, particularly in recent 
years, has passed numerous measures articulating the 
longstanding and bipartisan commitment to human rights 
in China, including— 
(1) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Account-
ability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114– 
328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note); 
(2) the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–330); 
(3) the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy 
Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–76); and 
(4) the bill S. 3744 (116th Congress), the Uyghur 
Human Rights Policy Act; 
Whereas on this day we stand in solidarity with human rights 
lawyers, labor and free speech advocates, religious 
groups, and ethnic minorities in China, such as Tibetans, 
and also Uyghurs and other predominately Muslim ethnic 
minorities who face mass internment and surveillance, 
forced labor and family separations, and who are often 
forced to renounce their faith; and 
Whereas on this day, we remember the words of the late 
Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo, who said there is ‘‘no force 
that can put an end to the human quest for freedom, and 
China will in the end become a nation ruled by law, 
where human rights reign supreme’’: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
