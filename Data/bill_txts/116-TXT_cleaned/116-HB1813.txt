SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
14
Congress finds that— 
15
(1) Atlantic Richfield is performing environ-
16
mental response actions under CERCLA at the Site 
17
with the State’s Division of Environmental Protec-
18
tion in the lead oversight role; 
19
(2) to comprehensively and efficiently facilitate 
20
the environmental remediation and reclamation at 
21
the Site, Atlantic Richfield requires access to land 
22
that is owned by the Federal Government; 
23
(3) more than half of the acreage located within 
24
the Site’s boundaries is owned by the Federal Gov-
25

ernment and managed by the BLM, and, therefore, 
1
attempting to implement a CERCLA remedy on 
2
BLM-managed lands requires extensive coordination 
3
and can involve substantial delays and increased 
4
costs; 
5
(4) because the historic releases and elements 
6
of the remedy do not follow existing property bound-
7
aries, reducing any inconsistent treatment based on 
8
land ownership will benefit cost management, effi-
9
ciency of operations and maintenance, and long-term 
10
protectiveness; 
11
(5) the United States may be designated as a 
12
potentially responsible party under CERCLA and 
13
accordingly could be assigned a significant liability 
14
share for CERCLA response costs; 
15
(6) at the time of conveyance, the Federal se-
16
lected lands will be unburdened by mining claims; 
17
(7) the conveyance of the Federal selected lands 
18
will promote economic development within the Coun-
19
ty by consolidating private land for future mining 
20
activities; 
21
(8) the BLM has routinely conveyed lands to 
22
potentially responsible parties to facilitate remedial 
23
actions; 
24
23:17 Apr 01, 2019
H1813
5 
•HR 1813 IH
(9) a legislated land conveyance is necessary to 
1
meet the remediation goals of the Site, promote eco-
2
nomic development in the County, and for BLM and 
3
the United States to receive a covenant not to sue 
4
and indemnity for certain potential liabilities relat-
5
ing to the Site; 
6
(10) the Federal selected lands contain con-
7
tamination and hazardous waste, and therefore the 
8
fair market value of such lands is minimal; 
9
(11) the United States potential CERCLA li-
10
ability at the Site is substantially greater than the 
11
fair market value of the Federal selected lands; and 
12
(12) the BLM and Atlantic Richfield have con-
13
cluded that conveyance of the Federal selected lands 
14
to Atlantic Richfield in exchange for resolution of 
15
certain United States liabilities is reasonable, logical, 
16
advisable, and in the public interest.

SEC. 4. CONVEYANCE OF LAND; RESOLUTION OF FEDERAL 
18

5
any claims or causes of action against the BLM or

CERCLA response costs that Atlantic Richfield has 
8
incurred or will incur at or relating to the Site; and

liabilities that result from Atlantic Richfield’s activi-
11
ties on the Federal selected lands after the convey-
12
ance.

(c) EQUAL VALUE.—The value of the Federal se-

poses of this Act or the conveyance of the Federal selected
