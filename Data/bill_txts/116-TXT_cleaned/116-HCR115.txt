violent terrorist attacks and events (referred to in this

ington, DC, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, leading to the 
tragic deaths and injuries of thousands of innocent 
United States citizens and others from more than 90 dif-
ferent countries and territories; 
Whereas, in response to the attacks, firefighters, uniformed 
officers, emergency medical technicians, physicians,

mediately rose to service in the heroic attempt to save the 
lives of the individuals in danger; 
Whereas, in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, thou-
sands of recovery workers, including trades personnel, 
iron workers, equipment operators, and many others, 
joined with uniformed officers and military personnel to 
help search for and recover victims lost in the attacks; 
Whereas, in the days, weeks, and months following the at-
tacks, thousands of individuals in the United States 
spontaneously volunteered to help support rescue and re-
covery efforts, braving both physical and emotional hard-
ship; 
Whereas many first responders, rescue and recovery workers, 
volunteers, and survivors of the attacks continue to suffer 
from serious medical illnesses and emotional distress re-
lated to the physical and mental trauma of the attacks; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of brave individuals continue 
to serve every day, answering the call to duty as members 
of the Armed Forces, with some having given their lives 
or suffered injury— 
(1) to defend the security of the United States; and 
(2) to prevent further terrorist attacks; 
Whereas people of the United States witnessed and endured 
the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and, in the imme-
diate aftermath of the attacks, became unified under a 
remarkable spirit of service and compassion that inspired 
the people of the United States; 
Whereas, in the years immediately following the attacks, 
there was a marked increase in volunteerism and national 
service among the people of the United States, which 
continues to this day;

•HCON 115 IH 
Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed, and President Barack 
Obama signed, the bipartisan Serve America Act (Public 
Law 111–13; 123 Stat. 1460), which— 
(1) established, at the request of the 9/11 commu-
nity, Federal recognition of September 11 as a ‘‘National 
Day of Service and Remembrance’’ (commonly referred 
to as ‘‘9/11 Day’’); and 
(2) charged the Corporation for National and Com-
munity Service with leading that annual day of service; 
Whereas, during the period beginning on the date of estab-
lishment of September 11 as a National Day of Service 
and Remembrance, millions of individuals in the United 
States observe that date by engaging in a wide range of 
service activities and private forms of prayer and remem-
brance; 
Whereas, during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) 
national emergency— 
(1) Americans have once again rallied together to 
rise to the challenge by caring for the sick, providing es-
sential services, and volunteering in their communities; 
and 
(2) there have been robust calls to strengthen, ex-
pand, and participate in all forms of national and com-
munity service; and 
Whereas the trends described in the preceding clause are the 
continuation of an American tradition of individuals and 
communities coming together to serve each other in times 
of need: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress—
