eries of natural gas off of the Cypriot coast could

7
Cyprus, and Greece for the purpose of research and 
8
development of energy sources would be in the na-
9
tional interests of not only the United States, but 
10
also Israel, and other countries in the Eastern Medi-

terranean and North Africa with similar natural gas

finds.

dustrial Research and Development Foundation

Mediterranean region must be safeguarded against

threats posed by terrorist and extremist groups, in-
3
cluding Hezbollah and others.

(18) The energy exploration in the Republic of 
5
Cyprus’s Exclusive Economic Zone and territorial

waters— 
7
(A) furthers United States interests by 
8
providing a potential alternative to Russian gas

(B) should not be impeded by other sov-
11

(23) Cyprus continues to work closely with the 
1
United Nations and regional partners in Europe to 
2
combat terrorism and violent extremism. 
3
(24) Cyprus has been used as an offshore bank-
4
ing hub. While Cyprus is working to upgrade its 
5
anti-money laundering legal framework, the Depart-
6
ment of State’s 2019 International Narcotics Con-
7
trol Strategy Report (INCSR) noted that, ‘‘the Cyp-
8
riot financial system is vulnerable to money laun-
9
dering by domestic and foreign criminal enterprises 
10
and individuals’’ and that ‘‘organized criminal 
11
groups and others have reportedly used Cypriot 
12
banks to launder proceeds, particularly from Rus-
13
sian and Ukrainian illicit activity.’’ 
14
(25) As of February 2019, Cyprus has taken 
15
steps to address legitimate criticism of its use of in-
16
vestor citizenship schemes (known as ‘‘golden pass-
17
ports’’), which have in the past allowed Russian 
18
oligarchs under United States sanctions to obtain 
19
Cypriot passports and gain full access to the Euro-
20
pean Union. 
21
(26) United Nations Security Council Resolu-
22

themselves to . . . limiting and then substantially

reducing the level of all troops and armaments in

5
(27) A 1987 United States arms prohibition 
6
was designed to restrict United States arms sales 
7
and transfer to Cyprus and the occupied part of Cy-
8
prus to avoid hindering reunification efforts. 
9
(28) At least 40,000 Turkish troops are sta-
10
tioned in the occupied part of Cyprus. 
11
(29) While the United States has, as a matter 
12
of policy, avoided the provision of defense articles 
13
and services to Cyprus, the Government of Cyprus 
14
has, in the past, sought to obtain defense articles 
15
from other countries, such as Russia, that pose chal-
16
lenges to United States interests around the world.
