CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the need to improve physical access to many 
federally funded facilities for all people of the United 
States, particularly people with disabilities. 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Constitution prevents 
Congress from making any law respecting an establish-
ment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise of religion, 
or abridging the freedom of speech, the freedom of the 
press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for 
a governmental redress of grievances, and was adopted

on December 15, 1791, as 1 of the 10 amendments that 
constitute the Bill of Rights; 
Whereas the Bill of Rights, specifically the First Amendment 
to the Constitution, calls for the right of all persons to 
peaceably assemble, and to this end, all persons, regard-
less of their physical ability, shall be offered equal oppor-
tunity to access all federally funded, in whole or part, 
amenities, with the exception of certain sites of historical 
importance approved by the United States Access Board 
or a nonpartisan commission convened by said United 
States Access Board; 
Whereas in the 29 years since the signing of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) 
(in this preamble referred to as the ‘‘ADA’’), there have 
been unprecedented advances in all forms of technology, 
typified by automatic doors; 
Whereas, in 2012, nearly 20 percent of the civilian population 
in the United States reported having a disability as de-
fined by the ADA; 
Whereas, in the 2010 census, more than 38,000,000 people 
were reported as having a severe disability; 
Whereas disability is a universal concern, as an aging popu-
lation increases the incidence of frailty and disability; 
Whereas, as significant advances in medical treatment result 
in increased survival rates, the incidence of disability in-
creases; 
Whereas, in 2012, 16 percent of veterans, amounting to more 
than 3,500,000 people, received service-related disability 
benefits; 
Whereas, in 2011, the percentage of working-age people in 
the United States who reported having a work limitation

due to a disability was 7 percent, which is a 20-year 
high; 
Whereas the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to insure that certain 
buildings financed with Federal funds are so designed 
and constructed as to be accessible to the physically 
handicapped’’, approved August 12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. 
4151 et seq.) (commonly known as the Architectural Bar-
riers Act of 1968), was enacted to ensure that certain 
federally funded facilities are designed and constructed to 
be accessible to people with disabilities; 
Whereas the United States Access Board (in this preamble 
referred to as the ‘‘Board’’) has developed new guidelines 
for public rights-of-way that will address various issues, 
including access for blind pedestrians at street crossings, 
wheelchair access to on-street parking, and various con-
straints posed by space limitations, roadway design prac-
tices, slope, and terrain; 
Whereas the Board’s new guidelines will cover pedestrian ac-
cess to sidewalks and streets, including crosswalks, curb 
ramps, street furnishings, pedestrian signals, parking, 
and other components of public rights-of-way; 
Whereas the Board’s aim in developing these guidelines is to 
ensure that access for persons with disabilities is pro-
vided wherever a pedestrian way is newly built or altered, 
and that the same degree of convenience, connection, and 
safety afforded the public generally is available to pedes-
trians with disabilities; 
Whereas once these guidelines are adopted by the Depart-
ment of Justice, they will become enforceable standards 
under title II of the ADA; and
