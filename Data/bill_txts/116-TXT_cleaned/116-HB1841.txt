•HR 1841 IH
(1) According to the Bureau of Health Work-
1
force, the United States faces a shortage of physi-
2
cians. 
3
(2) A 2016 study entitled ‘‘Supply and Demand 
4
of General Surgeons: Projections From 2014–2030’’, 
5
prepared by the University of North Carolina at 
6
Chapel Hill for the American College of Surgeons, 
7
found that the supply of general surgeons will grow 
8
slightly by 2030 but will not keep up with overall 
9
growth in the United States population or demand 
10
for surgical services. 
11
(3) A 2018 report released by the American As-
12
sociation of Medical Colleges projects shortages in 
13
all surgical specialties of between 20,700 and 30,500 
14
surgeons by 2030. 
15
(4) In order to accurately prepare for future 
16
physician workforce demands, comprehensive, impar-
17
tial research and high quality data are needed to in-
18
form dynamic projections of physician workforce 
19
needs. 
20
(5) A variety of factors, including health out-
21
comes, utilization trends, growing and aging popu-
22
lations, and delivery system changes, influence work-
23
force needs and should be considered as part of 
24
flexible projections of workforce needs.

•HR 1841 IH
(6) Given the particularly acute needs in many 
1
rural and other surgical workforce shortage areas, 
2
additional efforts to assess the adequacy of the cur-
3
rent general surgeon workforce are necessary.
