Whereas the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellow-
ship Program was established in 1990, and formalized by 
law in 1994; 
Whereas Einstein Fellows are selected through a highly com-
petitive process from among the best science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics teachers in the field, and 
represent diverse geographic regions and communities; 
Whereas the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellow-
ship Program places these exceptional teachers in posi-
tions within Federal agencies and on Capitol Hill where

science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and public 
policy; 
Whereas the Department of Energy, through its Office of 
Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists and 
the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, has 
nurtured and grown the Albert Einstein Distinguished 
Educator Fellowship Program; 
Whereas over 337 Einstein Fellows have served professionally

nology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration, the National Science Foundation, the President’s 
Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department

the application and impact of education policy;
