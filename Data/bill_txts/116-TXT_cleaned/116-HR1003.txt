RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing wasteful Pentagon spending and supporting cuts to 
the bloated defense budget. 
Whereas Pentagon spending since 9/11 adjusted for inflation 
has increased by almost 50 percent; 
Whereas the United States has spent an estimated 
$6,000,000,000,000 on military operations since Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and has been at war constantly since 
then;

HRES 1003 IH1S 
Whereas the Pentagon’s budget in fiscal year 2020 totaled 
$738,000,000,000, including for base and Overseas Con-
tingency Operations; 
Whereas while Pentagon spending continues to rise, spending 
on diplomacy has stalled or been reduced, resulting in an 
overreliance on military action and insufficient use of dip-
lomatic and other nonmilitary tools; 
Whereas only one-third of discretionary spending is available 
for important domestic priorities that help reduce poverty 
and inequality, including public health, education, hous-
ing, energy, diplomacy, and others; 
Whereas the Pentagon failed its first ever agencywide audit 
in November 2018; 
Whereas 
the 
Department 
of 
Defense 
spent 
nearly 
$1,000,000,000 in activities related to the 2018 audit 
and achieving an agencywide audit could take years if it 
is to ever achieve one, let alone pass; 
Whereas the audit revealed significant technology systems, 
security, and organizational deficiencies in the Depart-
ment of Defense’s financial management systems; 
Whereas the Pentagon’s first ever agencywide audit occurred 
nearly 30 years after the passage of the Chief Financial 
Officers Act of 1990, which established the requirement 
for annual audits of financial statements for Federal 
agencies; 
Whereas the Pentagon’s second agencywide audit in Novem-
ber 2019 uncovered 1,300 new deficiencies; 
Whereas in 32 cases Pentagon contractors provided false in-
formation about their ownership and were accused or 
found guilty of price gouging, providing poor-quality 
goods and services, abusing programs intended for small

businesses, and improperly disseminating sensitive infor-
mation; 
Whereas the Pentagon continues to reveal high levels of 
waste and fraud, including, for example— 
(1) the Pentagon awarded a $7,000,000 cloud-com-
puting contract to a 1-person company; 
(2) the Defense Logistics Agency lost track of 
$800,000,000 in construction projects; 
(3) last year, the Pentagon spent $4,600,000 on 
crab and lobster in an-end-of-the-year spree; and 
(4) the Pentagon had no way to track replacement 
parts for the $1,400,000,000,000 F–35 Joint Strike 
Fighter program; 
Whereas the military budget accounts for more than half of 
all discretionary spending; 
Whereas according to the Government Accountability Office, 
the Department of Defense has more unheeded audit rec-
ommendations than any other agency; 
Whereas it remains Congress’ intent to reduce defense waste, 
increase transparency, and reduce or eliminate poor man-
agement practices at the Department of Defense; 
Whereas Congress remains deeply concerned about the De-
partment of Defense’s inability to achieve an unqualified 
audit opinion as it is the only Federal agency yet to pass 
one; 
Whereas every hour taxpayers are paying $32,080,000 for 
total cost of wars since 2001, and these endless wars 
have not made Americans safer or brought democracy or 
stability to the Middle East, indeed they have further de-
stabilized the region and show no sign of actually ending 
or achieving any of the long-ago stated goals; 
19:38 Jun 17, 2020

HRES 1003 IH1S 
Whereas interviews with senior military leaders and other 
senior officials showed many believed the war in Afghani-
stan to be unwinnable and knowingly misled the public 
for years; 
Whereas in addition to defense base spending in fiscal year 
2020, Congress provided close to $72,000,000,000 for de-
fense Overseas Contingency Operations, which has en-
abled continuing military actions and wars in several 
countries, without specific congressional authorization 
and many almost hidden from the American people; 
Whereas the Overseas Contingency Operations account func-
tions as a make-war-easy budget gimmick, and has grown 
significantly to fund wars and military actions overseas, 
which Congress has yet to authorize; 
Whereas the continual use of Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations funds, especially for the cost of ‘‘enduring require-
ments’’ rather than unexpected emergencies is the oppo-
site of a ‘‘contingency account’’ and has resulted in less 
oversight, less transparency, and higher levels of waste; 
Whereas $1,800,000,000,000 in appropriations has gone into 
the Overseas Contingency Operations account since 2001; 
Whereas 
the 
Department 
of 
Defense 
transferred 
$6,100,000,000 in previously appropriated fiscal year 
2019 department funds to build an unnecessary and im-
moral wall at the southern border and is planning to 
transfer an additional $7,200,000,000 in fiscal year 2020 
appropriated funds for the wall; 
Whereas spending on sustaining and modernizing the exces-
sively large United States nuclear arsenal is projected by 
the 
Congressional 
Budget 
Office 
at 
nearly 
$500,000,000,000 between fiscal years 2019 and 2028; 
19:38 Jun 17, 2020

HRES 1003 IH1S 
Whereas 
world 
military 
spending 
totaled 
more 
than 
$1,600,000,000,000 in 2015, with the United States ac-
counting for 37 percent of the total; 
Whereas the United States spends more on defense spending 
than the next seven countries in the world, including 
China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Kingdom, India, 
France, and Japan, combined; 
Whereas the United States could save an estimated 
$350,000,000,000 per year by cutting defense spending 
on our endless wars and by cutting unnecessary and 
wasteful defense spending and would still be spending 
more on the military than China, Russia, Iran, and 
North Korea combined; 
Whereas despite concerns about depriving the troops of fund-
ing, half the military budget goes directly to military 
manufacturing corporations whose top five CEOs in 2016 
averaged $19,000,000 in salaries, while 23,000 active- 
duty United States servicemembers and their families 
qualified for food stamps because their salaries are too 
low; 
Whereas there have been significant deficiencies in the health 
and safety of housing for military families, including 
mold blooms, collapsed ceilings, exposed lead paint, and 
unsafe drinking water; 
Whereas in recent public opinion polls, a majority of Ameri-
cans indicate they do not want Pentagon funding in-
creases and a University of Maryland poll in July 2018 
found that Republicans and Democrats alike would sup-
port large-scale Federal spending cuts to defense; 
Whereas the Pentagon must realign its security mission, in-
terests, and values to ensure our Nation is spending tax-

HRES 1003 IH1S 
payers’ dollars wisely and that our military spending does 
not distort our budget by maintaining a war economy, or 
encourage too frequent reliance on military rather than 
diplomatic options; 
Whereas any spending cuts to the Pentagon could be rein-
vested in other important domestic priorities to help re-
duce poverty and increase economic opportunity in com-
munities across the country; and 
Whereas the Pentagon could significantly decrease its spend-
ing by— 
(1) eliminating the Overseas Contingency Operations 
account and saving $68,800,000,000; 
(2) closing 60 percent of foreign bases and saving 
$90,000,000,000; 
(3) ending wars and war funding and saving 
$66,000,000,000; 
(4) cutting unnecessary weapons that are obsolete, 
excessive, and dangerous and saving $57,900,000,000; 
(5) cutting military overhead by 15 percent and sav-
ing $38,000,000,000; 
(6) cutting private service contracting by 15 percent 
and saving $26,000,000,000; 
(7) eliminating the proposal for the Space Force and 
saving $2,600,000,000; 
(8) ending use-it-or-lose-it contract spending and 
saving $18,000,000,000; 
(9) freezing operations and maintenance budget lev-
els and saving $6,000,000,000; and 
(10) reducing United States presence in Afghanistan 
by half and saving $23,150,000,000: Now, therefore, be

(2) it remains Congress’ intent to reduce de-

fense waste, increase transparency, and reduce or

eliminate poor management practices at the Depart-

(3) Congress can and should make significant

cuts to the budget of the Pentagon while simulta-

neously improving support for the members of the

Armed Forces, by reducing unnecessary spending 
12
and reinvesting in our troops;

(4) Congress must exercise aggressive oversight
