A BILL 
To ensure that the United States recognizes women’s varied 
roles in all aspects of violent extremism and terrorism 
and promotes their meaningful participation as full part-
ners in all efforts to prevent and counter violent extre-
mism and terrorism, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Women play diverse roles in violent extrem-
3
ist organizations, including as victims, perpetrators, 
4
and preventers. 
5
(2) Extremist groups benefit strategically and 
6
financially from the subjugation of women. Terrorist 
7
groups violate the rights of women and girls, from 
8
sexual enslavement and forced marriages to limiting 
9
their access to education and public life. Violent ex-
10
tremist groups have used women and girls as re-
11
wards for new recruits and as part of their recruit-
12
ment efforts. According to the 2016 U.S. State De-
13
partment’s Country Reports on Terrorism, ‘‘In 2015 
14
and 2016, ISIS abducted, systematically raped, and 
15
abused thousands of women and children [in Iraq 
16
and Syria], some as young as eight years of age. 
17
Women and children were sold and enslaved, distrib-
18
uted to ISIS fighters as spoils of war, forced into 
19
marriage and domestic servitude, or subjected to 
20
physical and sexual abuse.’’. In northern Nigeria, 
21
Boko Haram has kidnapped and subjected thou-
22
sands of women and girls to physical abuse, forced 
23
labor, forced marriage and sexual abuse. 
24
(3) As perpetrators of violent extremism and 
25
terrorism, women adopt all roles, including as in-
26
03:54 Mar 22, 2019

•HR 1653 IH
formants, facilitators, recruiters, and suicide bomb-
1
ers. Empowering women may diminish their support 
2
for violent extremist organizations by increasing 
3
their sense of agency. 
4
(4) Seeing women as partners empowers them 
5
to detect early signs of radicalization, intervening 
6
before individuals become violent and delegitimizing 
7
violent extremist narratives. Analysis by the Council 
8
on Foreign Relations concluded that, ‘‘Anti-ter-
9
rorism messages are disseminated quite effectively 
10
throughout families and communities by women, who 
11
can challenge extremist narratives in homes, schools 
12
and social environments, and have particular influ-
13
ence among youth populations.’’. 
14
(5) Extremist groups take strategic advantage 
15
of the relative absence of women in police and mili-
16
tary forces. As security officials, women provide dis-
17
tinct insights, information, and analyses that can be 
18
mission-critical in keeping the peace. They may have 
19
access to populations and sites that men do not, al-
20
lowing them to gather critical intelligence about po-
21
tential security threats. 
22
(6) Research has demonstrated a relationship 
23
between the security of women and the security of 
24
states. According to a Texas A&M study, less em-
25
03:54 Mar 22, 2019

•HR 1653 IH
powerment for women in the household correlates 
1
with less stability nationwide, measured by political 
2
instability, lack of freedoms, autocracy, corruption, 
3
and internal conflict. Countries where women are 
4
less empowered at the household level are also more 
5
likely to produce foreign fighters going to territory 
6
controlled by terrorist organizations. 
7
(7) Counterterrorism policy has not been as ef-
8
fective at understanding how women can improve se-
9
curity efforts. According to the June 2016 U.S. Na-
10
tional Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security, 
11
‘‘A narrow understanding of women’s roles in CVE 
12
[countering violent extremism] limits policy options 
13
and perpetuates strategic blind spots, such as failing 
14
to recognize women’s agency as potential mitigators 
15
and perpetrators of violence.’’. 
16
(8) According to a 2015 United States Agency 
17
for International Development study of women’s 
18
participation in violent extremism, there has been ‘‘a 
19
marked gap in CVE [countering violent extremism] 
20
programming, which has focused mostly on male 
21
participation, without a commensurate reflection on 
22
and response to female-specific drivers and recruit-
23
ment strategies.’’.

(9) The ‘‘Department of State & USAID Joint 
1
Strategy on Countering Violent Extremism’’, dated 
2
May 2016, notes that ‘‘women can play a critical 
3
role in identifying and addressing drivers of violent 
4
extremism in their families, communities, and broad-
5
er society’’; and commits to supporting programs 
6
that engage women ‘‘as key stakeholders in pre-
7
venting and countering violent extremism in their 
8
communities’’. Women are on the front lines of ob-
9
serving and countering extremist violence, including 
10
as police officers engaging with local communities to 
11
prevent violent extremism, imams and other religious 
12
leaders preaching religious tolerance, and as those 
13
countering efforts to radicalize their husbands, chil-
14
dren, and communities. 
15
(10) The Women, Peace, and Security Act of 
16
2017 (Public Law 115–68) established that ‘‘Women 
17
in conflict-affected regions have achieved significant 
18
success in moderating violent extremism [and] coun-
19
tering terrorism.’’. 
20
(11) The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
21
2017 (Public Law 115–31) required the creation of 
22
a comprehensive, inter-agency United States Govern-
23
ment strategy to support women and girls at risk 
24
from extremism and conflict. Congress has also allo-
25

cated $45,000,000 to support women and girls at

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
3
It shall be the policy of the United States to recognize 
4
women’s varied roles in all aspects of violent extremism 
5
and terrorism, including as victims, perpetrators, and pre-
6
venters, and to promote the meaningful participation of 
7
women as full partners in all efforts to prevent and

counter violent extremism and terrorism.

non-United States-based women-led and women’s em-
14
powerment organizations in foreign countries working on 
15
countering violent extremism and terrorism in such coun-
16

(1) Supporting capacity-building efforts of such 
18
organizations and of women preventing and coun-
19

20
the use of conflict analysis tools and methodologies.
