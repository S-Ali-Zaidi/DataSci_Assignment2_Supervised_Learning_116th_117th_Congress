A BILL 
To amend title 35, United States Code, restore patent rights 
to inventors, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Inventor Rights Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Inventors have contributed significantly to 
7
innovation in the United States and their continued 
8
dedication to inventing and sharing solutions to 
9
modern technical challenges is essential for the

•HR 5478 IH
United States to maintain leadership in the global 
1
economy. 
2
(2) Inventors, not employees or investors, are 
3
the source of innovation intended by the Constitu-
4
tion (‘‘securing to inventors’’) and the Patent Act 
5
‘‘(Whoever invents or discovers . . . may obtain a 
6
patent therefore . . .)’’. 
7
(3) Recent changes to patent laws and proce-
8
dures and Supreme Court decisions have adversely 
9
affected inventors such that the promise of Article 1, 
10
section 8 of the Constitution of ‘‘securing for limited 
11
times to inventors the exclusive right to their discov-
12
eries’’ is no longer attainable. 
13
(4) Inventors are denied the fundamental right 
14
to ‘‘exclude others’’ by the Supreme Court’s 2006 
15
decision in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC. 
16
(5) Inventors were stripped of the right to file 
17
suit in their own judicial district by the Supreme 
18
Court’s 2017 decision in TC Heartland LLC v. 
19
Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC. 
20
(6) Issued patents fail to secure to inventors 
21
their exclusive rights because— 
22
(A) the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in-
23
stitutes trials in over 60 percent of cases and 
24
00:09 Dec 28, 2019

3 
•HR 5478 IH
invalidates one or more claims in over 80 per-
1
cent of trials which reach a final decision; 
2
(B) many patents are subjected to multiple 
3
post issuance reviews; or 
4
(C) most inventors cannot afford the costs 
5
of defending a patent challenged in a single 
6
post issuance review, as these costs can reach 
7
hundreds of thousand of dollars. 
8
(7) Infringement trials can cost tens of millions 
9
of dollars and can take up to ten years to reach a 
10
final judgment after all appeals, making legal relief 
11
unattainable for inventors. 
12
(8) These obstacles have given rise to an ‘‘effi-
13
cient infringement’’ business model whereby large 
14
corporations infringe patent rights held by inventors 
15
without concern for any legal consequences. 
16
(9) Patent protection has led to patient cures, 
17
positive changes to the standard of living for all peo-
18
ple in the United States, and improvements to the 
19
agricultural, telecommunications, software, biotech, 
20
pharmaceutical and electronics industries, among 
21
others.
