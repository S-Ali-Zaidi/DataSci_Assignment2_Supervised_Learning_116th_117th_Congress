•HCON 123 IH 
(1) Unauthorized United States military par-
1
ticipation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen has con-
2
tributed to producing the world’s largest humani-
3
tarian crisis, with an estimated 20 million people de-
4
pendent on food aid and two million children under 
5
five years of age requiring treatment for malnutri-
6
tion. Over five years of military conflict, 50 percent 
7
of Yemen’s healthcare infrastructure has closed, and 
8
Saudi-led bombings have destroyed over 70 hos-
9
pitals. COVID-19 is now spreading largely unde-
10
tected across Yemen’s immuno-compromised popu-
11
lation. 
12
(2) Congress has the sole power to declare war 
13
under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the United 
14
States Constitution. 
15
(3) Congress has not declared war with respect 
16
to, or provided a specific statutory authorization for, 
17
the conflict between military forces led by Saudi 
18
Arabia, including forces from the United Arab Emir-
19
ates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, 
20
Senegal, and Sudan (the Saudi-led coalition), 
21
against the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, in 
22
the Republic of Yemen. 
23
(4) Since March 2015, members of the United 
24
States Armed Forces have been introduced into hos-

•HCON 123 IH 
tilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the 
1
Houthis. 
2
(5) The conflict between the Saudi-led coalition 
3
and the Houthis constitutes, within the meaning of 
4
section 4(a) of the War Powers Resolution (50 
5
U.S.C. 1543(a)), either hostilities or a situation 
6
where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly 
7
indicated by the circumstances into which United 
8
States Armed Forces have been introduced. 
9
(6) Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution 
10
(50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states that, ‘‘at any time that 
11
United States Armed Forces are engaged in hos-
12
tilities outside the territory of the United States, its 
13
possessions and territories without a declaration of 
14
war or specific statutory authorization, such forces 
15
shall be removed by the President if the Congress so 
16
directs by concurrent resolution’’. 
17
(7) Section 8(c) of the War Powers Resolution 
18
(50 U.S.C. 1547(c)) defines the introduction of 
19
United States Armed Forces to include ‘‘the assign-
20
ment of members of such armed forces to command, 
21
coordinate, participate in the movement of, or ac-
22
company the regular or irregular military forces of 
23
any foreign country or government when such mili-
24
tary forces are engaged, or there exists an imminent

•HCON 123 IH 
threat that such forces will become engaged, in hos-
1
tilities’’, and activities that the United States has 
2
conducted in support of the Saudi-led coalition fall 
3
within this definition. 
4
(8) No specific statutory authorization for the 
5
use of United States Armed Forces with respect to 
6
the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and the 
7
Houthis in Yemen has been enacted, and no provi-
8
sion of law explicitly authorizes the assignment of 
9
United States Armed Forces to command, coordi-
10
nate, participate in the movement of, or accompany 
11
the regular or irregular military forces of the Saudi 
12
or United Arab Emirates in hostilities against Yem-
13
en’s Houthis. 
14

16
1544(c)), Congress hereby directs the President to remove 
17
United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the 
18
Houthis in the Republic of Yemen, except United States 
19
Armed Forces engaged in operations directed at Al Qaeda 
20
in the Arabian Peninsula or associated forces, by not later 
21
than the date that is 30 days after the date of the adoption 
22
of this concurrent resolution (unless the President re-
23
quests and the Congress authorizes a later date), and un-
24
less and until a declaration of war or specific authorization 
25

3
States Armed Forces to command, coordinate, participate 
4
in the movement of, or accompany the regular or irregular 
5
military forces of the Saudi or United Arab Emirates in 
6
hostilities against Yemen’s Houthis.
