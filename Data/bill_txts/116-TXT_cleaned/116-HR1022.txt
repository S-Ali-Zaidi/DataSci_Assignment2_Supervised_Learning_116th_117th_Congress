RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 75th anniversary of the commencement of 
continuous operations of the Stars and Stripes newspaper 
in the Pacific and the invaluable service of the Stars 
and Stripes as the ‘‘hometown newspaper’’ for members 
of the Armed Forces, civilian employees, and family 
members stationed across the globe. 
Whereas May 14, 2020, marks the 75th anniversary of the 
commencement of continuous operations, in service to the 
military community of the United States, of Stars and 
Stripes in the Pacific, a military newspaper established in 
Honolulu to provide an independent, uncensored news 
source for members of the Armed Forces fighting in 
World War II;

Whereas Stars and Stripes was heralded for indispensable 
service when it was initially established during the Civil 
War and again during World War I, when General John 
J. Pershing reestablished Stars and Stripes to provide 
news and information as an important morale-building 
force for soldiers serving in the American Expeditionary 
Force; 
Whereas after its permanent formation in World War II, 
Stars and Stripes started printing in Tokyo, Japan, on 
October 3, 1945, working in requisitioned space formally 
occupied by the Japan Times, and excelled in its mission 
across every theater of war, leading President Harry S. 
Truman to say later, ‘‘In Africa, Europe and the Pacific, 
The Stars and Stripes has established itself as a cher-
ished and important soldier’s institution.’’; 
Whereas Stars and Stripes has continuously covered news 
‘‘about the military, for the military’’ in conflicts from 
World War II to Korea to Vietnam to Bosnia and Kosovo 
to Iraq and Afghanistan; and 
Whereas while readership of newspapers has declined in re- 
cent years and technology has evolved, Stars and Stripes 
has innovated in finding new ways and products to de- 
liver the ‘‘hometown news’’ to the broadest portion of the 
military community, and through internet versions of the 
newspaper, social media, and other products, Stars and 
Stripes is now reaching 1,300,000 readers each day: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives, on the
