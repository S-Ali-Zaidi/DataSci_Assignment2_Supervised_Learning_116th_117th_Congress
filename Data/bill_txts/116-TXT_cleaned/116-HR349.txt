Whereas the current United States-Japan alliance, forged 
over six decades ago with the signing of the Treaty of 
Mutual Cooperation and Security, is the cornerstone for 
stability and prosperity of Japan and for the Indo-Pacific 
region, and plays a key role in global peace and stability; 
Whereas the United States and Japan are indispensable part-
ners in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, improving global health, countering human 
trafficking and promoting human rights, assisting the 
victims of conflict and disaster worldwide, and contrib-
uting to global economic development; 
Whereas the alliance is a testament to the ability of great na-
tions to overcome the past and jointly work to create a 
more secure and prosperous future; 
Whereas our two countries, coming from different cultural 
backgrounds, have created an active and dynamic rela-
tionship beneficial to both peoples; 
Whereas cultural and people-to-people ties between the 
United States and Japan are long-standing and deep, as 
exemplified by the gift of the beautiful cherry trees that 
dot our nation’s capital from the People of Japan to the 
People of the United States in 1912, signifying the affec-
tion and respect between the two nations: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) reaffirms the vital role of the United States- 
2
Japan alliance in promoting peace, stability, and

prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond;
