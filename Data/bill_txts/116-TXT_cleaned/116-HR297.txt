Whereas in that same year, the Fisk Jubilee Singers took all 
the funds in the University treasury with them for travel 
expenses and set off on a tour of the United States and 
Europe; 
Whereas during their first tour, the Jubilee Singers raised 
enough money to preserve their university and pay for 
the construction of Jubilee Hall, the South’s first perma-
nent structure built for the education of African-Amer-
ican students; 
Whereas the Jubilee Singers introduced the world to the spir-
itual as a musical genre, emerging as the first inter-
nationally recognized group of African-American musi-
cians; 
Whereas the Fisk Jubilee Singers continue to tour and per-
form and have received countless awards and honors; 
Whereas, on every October 6, Fisk University celebrates the 
original group of nine students and their music professor, 
George L. White, who toured internationally in hopes of 
raising money to save Fisk University from closing; and 
Whereas, on October 6, 2019, the Fisk University community 
will celebrate its 148th Jubilee Day: Now, therefore, be 
it
