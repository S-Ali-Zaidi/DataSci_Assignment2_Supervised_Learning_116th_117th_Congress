Whereas Congress signaled its support for family reunions 
between United States citizens and their relatives in 
North Korea in section 1265 of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110– 
181), signed into law by President George W. Bush on 
January 28, 2008; 
Whereas most of the population of divided family members in 
the United States, initially estimated at 100,000 in 2001, 
has significantly dwindled as many of the individuals 
have passed away; 
Whereas the summit between North Korea and South Korea 
on April 27, 2018, has prioritized family reunions; 
Whereas the United States and North Korea have engaged 
in talks during 2 historic summits in June 2018 in 
Singapore and February 2019 in Hanoi; and 
Whereas many Korean Americans are waiting for a chance to 
meet their relatives in North Korea for the first time in 
more than 60 years: Now, therefore, be it
