(2) As the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s 
1
recently released ‘‘2020 National Strategy for Com-
2
bating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing’’ con-
3
cludes, ‘‘While money laundering, terrorism financ-
4
ing, and WMD proliferation financing differ quali-
5
tatively and quantitatively, the illicit actors engaging 
6
in these activities can exploit the same vulnerabilities 
7
and financial channels.’’. 
8
(3) Among those are bad actors engaged in 
9
trafficking, whether they trade in drugs, arms, cul-
10
tural property, wildlife, natural resources, counter-
11
feit goods, organs, or, even, other humans. 
12
(4) Their illegal (or ‘‘dark’’) markets use simi-
13
lar and sometimes related or overlapping methods 
14
and means to acquire, move, and profit from their 
15
crimes. 
16
(5) In a March 2017, report from Global Fi-
17
nancial Integrity, ‘‘Transnational Crime and the De-
18
veloping World’’, the global business of transnational 
19
crime was valued at $1.6 trillion to $2.2 trillion an-
20
nually, resulting in crime, violence, terrorism, insta-
21
bility, corruption, and lost tax revenues worldwide.

13

14

15

16
cies, including the Department of the Treasury’s Fi-
17
nancial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Federal 
18
financial regulators, and law enforcement, provide to 
19
help financial institutions identify techniques and 
20
patterns of transactions that may involve the pro-
21
ceeds of trafficking;

(7) what role gatekeepers, such as lawyers, no-

4

6
laundering of illicit proceeds; and 
7
(8) the role that emerging technologies, includ-
8
ing artificial intelligence, digital identity tech-
9
nologies, blockchain technologies, virtual assets, and

of proceeds from trafficking.
