fensive, and prohibit the use of terms deemed derog-
1
atory or offensive in geographic place names;

7
American place names requires a systematic, public

process in which offensive and inappropriate place 
9
names are reviewed and replaced; and 
10
(8) such a process offers an opportunity for rec-
11
onciliation for the Americans who suffer from preju-
12
dice and racial violence and for all Americans in 
13
