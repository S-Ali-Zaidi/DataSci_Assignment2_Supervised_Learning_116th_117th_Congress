A BILL 
To amend title 10, United States Code, to expand benefits 
available under the TRICARE Extended Health Care 
Option program, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘TRICARE ECHO Im-
4
provement Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Active duty members of the uniformed serv-
8
ices encounter difficulties accessing Home and Com-

munity-Based Services (HCBS) waivers under Med-
1
icaid for the dependents of such members who have 
2
intellectual or developmental disabilities. 
3
(2) State residency requirements create barriers 
4
to accessing such benefits for military families who 
5
move across State lines and are required to reenroll 
6
with each permanent change of station. 
7
(3) Enrollment caps for such waivers create ad-
8
ditional barriers, and often result in waiting lists 
9
due to the demand for such waivers, including, in 
10
2017, an average 30-month wait time. 
11
(4) The Military Compensation and Retirement 
12
Modernization Commission concluded that ‘‘access to 
13
HCBS waiver benefits is a substantial issue for mili-
14
tary families . . . Service members are required to 
15
re-apply for benefits each time they move to a new 
16
state. Many Service members encounter waiting lists 
17
that exceed their time assigned to a location.’’. 
18
(5) In 2001, the TRICARE Extended Care 
19
Health Option program (‘‘ECHO program’’) was es-
20
tablished as an alternative to HCBS waivers for 
21
military families. The ECHO program provides addi-
22
tional medical and non-medical services not covered 
23
by TRICARE to eligible military dependents with 
24
special needs, for the purpose of assisting in the re-

duction of the disabling effects of the qualifying con-
1
dition of the dependent. 
2
(6) The Military Compensation and Retirement 
3
Modernization Commission concluded that, although 
4
ECHO was created as an alternative to HCBS waiv-
5
er benefits, ‘‘ECHO benefits, as currently imple-
6
mented, are not robust enough to replace state waiv-
7
er programs when those programs are inaccessible.’’ 
8
(7) Although the purpose of the ECHO pro-
9
gram is to provide supplemental services to depend-
10
ents with special needs, a 2014 study conducted by 
11
the Manpower Data Center of the Department of 
12
Defense found that only 37 percent of military fami-
13
lies that have a child with special needs were aware 
14
of the program. 
15
(8) The Conference Report accompanying the 
16
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
17
2010 stated that ‘‘expanding support for families 
18
with special needs is a critical requirement for the 
19
all-volunteer force.’’. 
20
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
21
It is the sense of Congress that military families de-
22
serve—
