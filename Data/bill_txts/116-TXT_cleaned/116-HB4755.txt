A BILL 
To establish the Food Safety Administration to protect the 
public health by preventing foodborne illness, ensuring 
the safety of food, improving research on contaminants 
leading to foodborne illness and the chronic health out-
comes associated with foodborne illnesses, improving the 
surveillance of foodborne pathogens (including foodborne 
pathogens identified as antibiotic resistant), and improv-
ing security of food from intentional contamination, and 
for other purposes.

1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) the safety of the food supply of the United 
3
States is vital to the public health, to public con-
4
fidence in the food supply, and to the success of the 
5
food sector of the Nation’s economy; 
6
(2) lapses in the protection of the food supply 
7
and loss of public confidence in food safety are dam-
8
aging to consumers and the food industry, and place 
9
a burden on interstate commerce; 
10
(3) the safety and security of the food supply 
11
requires an integrated, systemwide approach to pre-
12
venting foodborne illness, a thorough and broad- 
13
based approach to basic and applied research, and 
14
intensive, effective, and efficient management of the 
15
Nation’s food safety program; 
16
(4) the task of preserving the safety of the food 
17
supply of the United States faces tremendous pres-
18
sures with regard to—

•HR 4755 IH
(A) emerging pathogens and other con-
1
taminants and the ability to detect all forms of 
2
contamination; 
3
(B) an aging and immune-compromised 
4
population, with a growing number of people at 
5
high risk for foodborne illnesses, including in-
6
fants and children; 
7
(C) a concern regarding food fraud for eco-
8
nomic gain, especially with mislabeling and in-
9
tentionally misleading claims; 
10
(D) an increasing volume of imported food, 
11
without adequate monitoring and inspection; 
12
and 
13
(E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of 
14
the domestic food processing and food service 
15
industries; 
16
(5) Federal food safety standard setting, in-
17
spection, enforcement, and research efforts should be 
18
based on the best available science and public health 
19
considerations and food safety resources should be 
20
systematically deployed in ways that most effectively 
21
prevent foodborne illness; 
22
(6) the Federal food safety system is frag-
23
mented, with at least 15 Federal agencies sharing 
24
responsibility for food safety, and operates under 
25
02:44 Oct 29, 2019
H4755
5 
•HR 4755 IH
laws that do not reflect current conditions in the 
1
food system or current scientific knowledge about 
2
the cause and prevention of foodborne illness; 
3
(7) the fragmented Federal food safety system 
4
and outdated laws preclude an integrated, system-
5
wide approach to preventing foodborne illness, to the 
6
effective and efficient operation of the Nation’s food 
7
safety program, and to the most beneficial deploy-
8
ment of food safety resources; 
9
(8) the National Academy of Sciences rec-
10
ommended in the report ‘‘Ensuring Safe Food from 
11
Production to Consumption’’ that Congress establish 
12
by statute a unified and central framework for man-
13
aging Federal food safety programs, and rec-
14
ommended modifying Federal statutes so that in-
15
spection, enforcement, and research efforts are 
16
based on scientifically supportable assessments of 
17
risks to public health; and 
18
(9) the lack of a single focal point for food safe-
19
ty leadership in the United States undercuts the 
20
ability of the United States to exert food safety lead-
21
ership internationally, which is detrimental to the 
22
public health and the international trade interests of 
23
the United States.

(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are—

(1) to establish a single agency to be known as
