RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of June 19, 2019, as 
‘‘Juneteenth Independence Day’’ in recognition of June 
19, 1865, the date on which slavery legally came to 
an end in the United States. 
Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach the frontier 
areas of the United States, in particular the State of 
Texas and the other Southwestern States, until months 
after the conclusion of the Civil War, more than 21⁄2 
years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Eman-
cipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863; 
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, led by Major 
General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston, Texas, 
with news that the Civil War had ended and that the 
enslaved were free;

Whereas African Americans who had been slaves in the 
Southwest celebrated June 19, commonly known as 
‘‘Juneteenth Independence Day’’, as inspiration and en-
couragement for future generations; 
Whereas African Americans from the Southwest have contin-
ued the tradition of observing Juneteenth Independence 
Day for over 150 years;

observance in recognition of the emancipation of all 
slaves in the United States; 
Whereas Juneteenth Independence Day celebrations have 
been held to honor African-American freedom while en-
couraging self-development and respect for all cultures; 
Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by

main an example for all people of the United States, re-
gardless of background, religion, or race; 
Whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the ratifica-
tion of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States in December 1865; and 
Whereas, over the course of its history, the United States has

the world: Now, therefore, be it
