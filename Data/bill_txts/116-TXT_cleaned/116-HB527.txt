(a) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to fur-
3
ther the public interest by consummating the NorthMet 
4
Land Exchange as specifically set forth in this Act. 
5
(b) NEED.—According to the Final Record of Deci-
6
sion, the NorthMet Land Exchange is advisable and need-
7
ed because the NorthMet Land Exchange will— 
8
(1) result in a 40-acre net gain in National 
9
Forest System lands; 
10
(2) improve the spatial arrangement of Na-
11
tional Forest System lands by reducing the amount 
12
of ownership boundaries to be managed by 33 miles; 
13
(3) improve management effectiveness by ex-
14
changing isolated Federal lands with no public over-
15
land access for non-Federal lands that will have pub-
16
lic overland access and be accessible and open to 
17
public use and enjoyment; 
18
(4) result in Federal cost savings by eliminating 
19
certain easements and their associated administra-
20
tion costs;

(5) meet several of the priorities identified in 
1
the land and resource management plan for Superior 
2
National Forest to protect and manage administra-
3
tively or congressionally designated, unique, pro-
4
posed, or recommended areas, including acquisition 
5
of 307 acres of land to the administratively proposed 
6
candidate Research Natural Areas, which are man-
7
aged by preserving and maintaining areas for eco-
8
logical research, observation, genetic conservation, 
9
monitoring, and educational activities; 
10
(6) promote more effective land management 
11
that would meet specific National Forest needs for 
12
management, including acquisition of over 6,500 
13
acres of land for new public access, watershed pro-
14
tection, ecologically rare habitats, wetlands, water 
15
frontage, and improved ownership patterns; 
16
(7) convey Federal land generally not needed 
17
for other Forest resource management objectives, 
18
because such land is adjacent to intensively devel-
19
oped private land including ferrous mining areas, 
20
where abundant mining infrastructure and transpor-
21
tation are already in place, including— 
22
(A) a large, intensively developed open pit 
23
mine lying directly to the north of the Federal 
24
land;

(C) already existing ore processing, milling, 
4
and tailings facilities located approximately 5 
5
miles to the west of the Federal land; and 
6
(8) provide a practical resolution to complex 
7
issues pertaining to the development of private min-
8
eral rights underlying the Federal land surface, and 
9
thereby avoid potential litigation which could ad-
10
versely impact the status and management of the 
11
Federal land and other National Forest System land 
12
acquired under the authority of section 6 of the Act

of March 1, 1911 (commonly known as the Weeks

14
proximately $425,000.

18
ment to PolyMet to equalize exchange values under
