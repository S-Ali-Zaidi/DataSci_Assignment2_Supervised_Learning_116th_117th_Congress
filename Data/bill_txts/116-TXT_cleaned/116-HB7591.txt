A BILL 
To support the health and well-being of current and former 
foster care youth transitioning into adulthood. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fostering Healthy 
4
Transitions into Adulthood Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

The purpose of this Act is to foster healthy adult out-

comes for current and former foster care youth aging out

of the foster care system and transitioning into adulthood.

This Act also strengthens the direct responsibility of the 
2
Federal Government for foster care youth transitioning 
3
out of care. 
4
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Nearly 25,000 foster youth become too old 
7
to receive foster care assistance and benefits—or 
8
‘‘age out’’—every year. 
9
(2) Youth aging out of foster care and 
10
transitioning to independent living require consider-
11
able support from local, State, and Federal Govern-
12
ment to ensure a smooth transition into healthy, 
13
independent adulthood. 
14
(3) Foster youth are more likely to have been 
15
exposed to childhood and adolescent trauma, sub-
16
jected to multiple chronic health challenges, and di-
17
agnosed with poorer mental and physical health out-
18
comes than their peers. Additionally, foster youth 
19
are more vulnerable to suffer from persistent anx-
20
iety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and 
21
other severe challenges to their health. 
22
(4) As a result, youth aging out of foster care 
23
experience tremendous difficulty in completing edu-
24
cation, obtaining gainful employment, accessing and 
25
22:23 Aug 08, 2020
H7591

•HR 7591 IH
receiving basic health care, maintaining stable hous-
1
ing, and avoiding the criminal justice system. 
2
(5) Studies indicate that more than 80 percent 
3
of foster youth transitioning into adulthood are un-
4
able to support themselves financially. 
5
(6) Only 4 percent of youth aging out of foster 
6
care earn a college degree by age 26, as compared 
7
to 36 percent of individuals who never experience 
8
foster care. 
9
(7) On average, youth aging out of foster care 
10
earn approximately half the income of their similarly 
11
educated peers and are employed at significantly 
12
lower rates. 
13
(8) Accordingly, individuals transitioning out of 
14
foster care are often linked with homelessness and 
15
housing instability. One national study estimated 
16
that approximately 66 percent of former foster 
17
youth experience a homeless episode within 6 
18
months after transitioning out of care. 
19
(9) Moreover, youth aging out of foster care are 
20
less likely to seek health and mental care services 
21
that are often desperately needed. 
22
(10) Nearly 60 percent of young men who have 
23
aged out of foster care and of emancipated young 
24
men have been convicted of a crime.
