RESOLUTION 
Supporting infant nutrition through improved breastfeeding 
practices. 
Whereas all children have a right to safe, healthy, and bene-
ficial nourishment; 
Whereas studies have confirmed that breastmilk is the most 
developmentally beneficial 
nourishment 
for 
infants, 
though alternatives, such as infant formula, have a role 
in the life of a baby, if a parent so chooses; 
Whereas some people may choose not to breastfeed or are un-
able to do so; however, all parents can benefit from edu-
cation on infant nutrition and wellness;

Whereas an analysis published by The Lancet in 2016 deter-
mined that improved breastfeeding practices would annu-
ally save the lives of 820,000 children under 5 years of 
age and reduce infection-related mortality in infants 
under 3 months of age by 88 percent globally; 
Whereas breastfeeding is correlated with fewer infections, in-
creased cognitive performance, and reduction in rates of 
obesity and diabetes in children; 
Whereas studies support a positive correlation between 
breastfeeding and reduced rates of breast cancer in peo-
ple; 
Whereas there are sound economic gains associated with 
breastfeeding due to increased productivity, and analysis 
undertaken by the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) 
indicates that the global cost of lower cognitive ability in 
children to be $300 billion over 10 years; 
Whereas improved breastfeeding practices are reducing health 
gaps between high- and low-income countries globally; 
Whereas the public health and economic benefits of improved 
breastfeeding practices are positive factors contributing 
to well-being, prosperity, and stability; 
Whereas people of color experience heightened barriers to 
breastfeeding—including lack of resources, less flexible 
work conditions, and racially biased health care—leading 
potentially to poorer post-natal outcomes and health dis-
parities for communities of color; 
Whereas the American Academy of Family Physicians, Amer-
ican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Amer-
ican College of Nurse-Midwives, American Dietetic Asso-
ciation, and American Public Health Association, all rec-

ommend that most infants in the United States be 
breastfed for at least 12 months; 
Whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics further rec-
ommends exclusive breastfeeding of infants for about the 
first 6 months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding 
as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation 
of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer; 
Whereas breast milk is a natural, renewable food that acts 
as a complete source of babies’ nutrition and does not 
necessarily require additional packaging and its use has 
a uniquely positive environmental benefit; 
Whereas, in 1990, the United States signed onto the 
‘‘Innocenti Declaration on the Protection, Promotion and 
Support of Breastfeeding’’, as adopted by the WHO and 
UNICEF, requesting all governments to nationally co-
ordinate breastfeeding activities, ensure optimal practices 
in support of breastfeeding through maternity services, 
take action on the ‘‘International Code of Marketing of 
Breast-milk Substitutes’’, and enact legislation to protect 
breastfeeding in the workplace; 
Whereas, in 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices (HHS) released the ‘‘HHS Blueprint for Action on 
Breastfeeding’’ declaring breastfeeding to be a key public 
health issue in the United States; and 
Whereas the slogan for World Breastfeeding Week 2019 from 
August 1st to 7th is ‘‘Empower Parents, Enable 
Breastfeeding’’: Now, therefore, be it
