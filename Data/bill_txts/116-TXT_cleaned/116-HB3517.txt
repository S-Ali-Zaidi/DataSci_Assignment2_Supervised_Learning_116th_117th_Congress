8

9
of covered members at the request of the covered 
10
member; and 
11

(b) CRITERIA.—In changing the discharge character-
15
ization of a covered member to honorable under subsection

18

2
(2) Such discharge characterization shall be so 
3
changed if, with respect to the original discharge, 
4
there were no aggravating circumstances, such as 
5
misconduct, that would have independently led to a 
6
discharge characterization that was any character-
7
ization except honorable. For purposes of this para-
8
graph, such aggravating circumstances may not in-
9
clude— 
10
(A) an offense under section 925 of title 
11
10, United States Code (article 125 of the Uni-
12

15
(B) statements, consensual sexual conduct, 
16
or consensual acts relating to sexual orientation 
17
or identity, or the disclosure of such state-
18
ments, conduct, or acts, that were prohibited at 
19
the time of discharge but after the date of such 
20
discharge became permitted. 
21
(3) When requesting a review, a covered mem-
22
ber, or the member’s representative, shall be re-
23

3
cumstances surrounding the discharge; and 
4
(iii) any relevant records pertaining to 
5
the discharge; or 
6
(B) an affidavit certifying that the mem-

(4) If a covered member provides an affidavit 
11
described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3)— 
12
(A) the appropriate discharge board shall 
13
make every effort to locate the documents speci-
14
fied in subparagraph (A) of such paragraph 
15
within the records of the Department of De-
16
fense; and 
17
(B) the absence of such documents may 
18
not be considered a reason to deny a change of 
19
the discharge characterization under subsection 
20
(a)(2). 
21
(c) REQUEST FOR REVIEW.—The appropriate dis-
22
charge board shall ensure the mechanism by which covered 
23

or any other relevant information regarding the dis-
8
charge characterization of the covered member.

11

10
tive a revised DD–214 form that reflects the following: 
11
(1) For each covered member discharged, the 
12
Separation Code, Reentry Code, Narrative Code, and 
13
Separation Authority shall not reflect the sexual ori-
14
entation of the member and shall be placed under 
15
secretarial authority. Any other similar indication of 
16
the sexual orientation or reason for discharge shall 
17
be removed or changed accordingly to be consistent 
18
with this paragraph. 
19
(2) For each covered member whose discharge 
20
occurred prior to the creation of general secretarial 
21
authority, the sections of the DD–214 form referred 
22
to paragraph (1) shall be changed to similarly reflect 
23
a universal authority with codes, authorities, and 
24
language applicable at the time of discharge.
