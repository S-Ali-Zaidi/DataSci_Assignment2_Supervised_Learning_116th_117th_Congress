tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The planet risks increasingly catastrophic 
3
impacts unless global average temperatures are lim-
4
ited to no more than 2° C, aiming for 1.5° C above 
5
preindustrial levels. 
6
(2) According to the Intergovernmental Panel 
7
on Climate Change’s Special Report on 1.5° C, lim-
8
iting warming to no more than 1.5° C requires fast 
9
mitigation of both CO2 and non-CO2 climate pollut-
10
ants, as well as the protection and expansion of for-
11
ests and other sinks that remove and store CO2, 
12
along with other strategies for removing CO2 and 
13
other climate pollutants. 
14
(3) Forced displacement and forced migration 
15
are increasingly caused or exacerbated by environ-
16
mental changes and climate-induced disruptions. 
17
(4) The United National Human Rights Coun-
18
cil has recognized that climate change poses an exis-
19
tential threat that has already had a negative impact 
20
on the fulfillment of human rights. 
21
(5) To have a chance at limiting warming to 
22
1.5° C and avoiding increasingly severe impacts from 
23
climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
24
mate Change (IPCC) concluded that global net an-
25
thropogenic carbon dioxide emissions must fall by 45

percent from global 2010 levels by 2030 and reach 
1
net-zero by 2050. 
2
(6) Failure to act on the climate crisis leads to 
3
higher levels of warming and exposes all regions of 
4
the world to potentially catastrophic insecurity and 
5
destabilization that could cause a breakdown of 
6
economies, social systems, and political institutions 
7
in ways that are likely irreversible. It is in the inter-
8
est of the United States to place a high priority on 
9
strengthening the global response to the threat of 
10
climate change. 
11
(7) United States leadership and ingenuity are 
12
central to solving the climate crisis. The United 
13
States must act urgently, guided by science, and in 
14
concert with the international community to signifi-
15
cantly reduce emissions, prepare for climate impacts, 
16
and drive progress through international negotia-
17
tions to maintain a livable climate for today and fu-
18
ture generations. 
19
(8) The United States can also build strong sci-
20
entific and security partnerships and reinforce the 
21
United States ability to lead on other key global pri-
22
orities through climate diplomacy. These efforts can 
23
foster climate security while creating new opportuni-

ties for United States leadership, economic growth, 
1
and innovation. 
2
(9) The United States is a Party to the United 
3
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
4
(referred to in this Act as the ‘‘Convention’’), as 
5
agreed to by the advice and consent of the Senate 
6
on October 7, 1992, and should remain actively en-
7
gaged in the Convention. 
8
(10) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties 
9
to the Convention reached a landmark agreement to 
10
strengthen the global response to the threat of cli-
11
mate change by keeping a global temperature rise 
12
well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial lev-
13
els and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature in-
14
crease even further to 1.5° C. 
15
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
16
gress that the United States should— 
17
(1) utilize multilateral and bilateral foreign as-
18
sistance to promote low-carbon, climate-resilient de-
19
velopment, including supporting greater participa-
20
tion of women in the development and implementa-
21
tion of climate policies that are gender-responsive;
