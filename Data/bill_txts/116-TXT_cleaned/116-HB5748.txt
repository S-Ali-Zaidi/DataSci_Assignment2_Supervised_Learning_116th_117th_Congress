A BILL 
To rebuild the Nation’s crumbling infrastructure, transpor-
tation systems, technology and computer networks, and 
energy distribution systems, by strongly and urgently 
encouraging the immediate recruitment, employment, and 
on-the-job ‘‘earn as you learn’’ training of young African 
Americans who throughout history experience higher un-
employment rates than any other race, which is a na-
tional crisis. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Jobs, On-the-Job 
2
‘Earn-While-You-Learn’ Training, and Apprenticeships 
3
for Young African-Americans Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Young African-American men and women 
7
are the hardest hit by economic instability. Declared 
8
and affirmed by the Federal Reserve, African Ameri-
9
cans face unemployment rates that are two to three 
10
times higher than their White counterparts for the 
11
last several decades. 
12
(2) During economic recessions in 1974–75, 
13
1981–82, 1990–91, and 2008, the African-American 
14
community faced significantly higher unemployment 
15
rates than their White counterparts. 
16
(3) Even during times of economic growth, Af-
17
rican-American communities experience prolonged fi-
18
nancial vulnerability and delayed recovery. Unem-
19
ployment rates decline at a slower rate for African- 
20
American men, and even a slower rate for African- 
21
American women as compared to their White coun-
22
terparts. 
23
(4) This extraordinarily high unemployment 
24
rate has a terrible rippling impact on the breakdown 
25

of the family structure, as men and women in this 
1
age group are in the primary child-producing ages. 
2
(5) Affirmed by the Department of Labor, di-
3
versity and inclusion within the workforce benefits 
4
employees and businesses across all industries, in-
5
cluding apprenticeship programs, which provide eco-
6
nomic mobility to its participants. 
7
(6) Through the combined efforts of building 
8
trades unions and community partners at the State 
9
and local level, there have been established more 
10
than 150 apprenticeship readiness programs across 
11
the United States that focus on creating pathways 
12
to Registered Programs for people of color, women, 
13
and veterans. Overall, from 2009 to 2019, building 
14
trades unions and their signatory contractors have 
15
invested over $100,000,000 in outreach efforts tar-
16
geting under-represented communities to participate 
17
in apprenticeship readiness programs. Of the 4,800 
18
individuals who have successfully completed a build-
19
ing trades apprenticeship readiness program since 
20
2016, 70 percent were from communities of color 
21
and 22 percent were women. 
22
(7) The disproportionately high-unemployment 
23
rates, combined with low participation rates from 
24
African Americans in registered apprenticeship pro-

grams not only constitute a national crisis but a na-
1
tional tragedy for the young African Americans, 
2
many of whom are fathers and mothers who, without 
3
jobs, are unable to provide for their families or 
4
home. 
5
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to secure 
6
jobs, on-the-job training, and apprenticeships for young 
7
African Americans ages 18 to 39 with the labor unions, 
8
general contractors, and businesses who will rebuild the 
9
Nation’s crumbling infrastructure in cities and commu-
10
nities throughout the Nation. 
11
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
12
It is the sense of Congress that— 
13
(1) this Act, while rebuilding the crumbling in-
14
frastructure of this great Nation, will simultaneously 
15
help create good paying jobs and job training that 
16
will provide young African Americans ages 18 to 39 
17
with the technical skills, computer capabilities, and 
18
other skills necessary in this high technology-driven 
19
job market, thus providing young African Americans 
20
with highly developed skills that will make them very 
21
competitive and attractive to many employers; 
22
(2) this Act greatly exemplifies and strengthens 
23
the high nobility of purpose that is the founding 
24
grace of this great Nation; and

(3) the African-American organizations de-
1
scribed in section 4(c) have a long and rich history 
2
of working to improve the lives of African Ameri-
3
cans, and can be very helpful in successfully reach-
4
ing, contacting, and recruiting unemployed young 
5
African Americans.

16
described in subsection (a) by reaching out and seeking 
17
