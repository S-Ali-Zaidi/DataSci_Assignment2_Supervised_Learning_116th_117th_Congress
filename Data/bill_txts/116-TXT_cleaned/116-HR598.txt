RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for addressing diaper need by donating 
generously to diaper banks, diaper drives, and organiza-
tions that distribute diapers to families in need. 
Whereas diaper need, the condition of not having a sufficient 
supply of clean diapers to keep babies and toddlers clean, 
dry, and healthy, can adversely affect the health and 
well-being of babies, toddlers, and their families; 
Whereas national surveys and research studies report that 1 
in 3 families struggles with diaper need and 48 percent 
of families delay changing a diaper to extend their sup-
ply; 
Whereas children go through 6 to 12 diapers each day during 
the 2 to 3 years they wear diapers;

Whereas purchasing enough diapers to keep a baby or toddler 
clean, dry, and healthy can consume 14 percent of a low- 
wage family’s post-tax income, making it difficult to ob-
tain a sufficient supply; 
Whereas a daily or weekly supply of diapers is generally an 
eligibility requirement for babies and toddlers to partici-
pate in child-care programs and high-quality early-edu-
cation programs; 
Whereas without enough diapers, babies and toddlers risk in-
fections and health problems that may require medical 
attention, and may prevent parents from attending work 
or school, thereby hurting the family’s economic pros-
pects and well-being; 
Whereas addressing diaper need can lead to economic oppor-
tunity for families and communities and improved health 
for children, thus ensuring all children and families have 
access to the basic necessities required to thrive and 
reach their full potential; and 
Whereas the numerous committed staff and volunteers at dia-
per banks across the country work tirelessly in their com-
munities, distributing millions of diapers and serving 
hundreds of thousands of children each month: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) expresses its gratitude for those who oper-

3
programs in their local communities; 
4
(2) supports the important disaster relief ef-
