RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing United States efforts to resolve the Israeli-Pales-
tinian conflict through a negotiated two-state solution. 
Whereas the special relationship between the United States 
and Israel is rooted in shared national security interests 
and shared values of democracy, human rights, and the 
rule of law; 
Whereas the United States has worked for decades to 
strengthen Israel’s security through assistance and co-
operation on defense and intelligence matters in order to 
enhance the safety of United States and Israeli citizens; 
Whereas the United States remains unwavering in its com-
mitment to help Israel address the myriad challenges it 
faces, including terrorism, regional instability, horrifying

violence in neighboring states, and hostile regimes that 
call for its destruction; 
Whereas the United States has long sought a just, stable, 
and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
that recognizes the Palestinian right to self-determination 
and offers Israel long-term security and full normaliza-
tion with its neighbors; 
Whereas for more than 20 years, Presidents of the United 
States from both political parties and Israeli Prime Min-
isters have supported reaching a two-state solution that 
establishes a Palestinian state coexisting side by side with 
Israel in peace and security; 
Whereas for more than 20 years, Presidents of the United 
States from both political parties have opposed settlement 
expansion, moves toward unilateral annexation of terri-
tory, and efforts to achieve Palestinian statehood status 
outside the framework of negotiations with Israel; 
Whereas United States administrations from both political 
parties have put forward proposals to provide a frame-
work for negotiations toward a two-state solution, includ-
ing the parameters put forward by President Bill Clinton 
in December 2000, the Road Map proposed by President 
George W. Bush in April 2003, and the principles set 
forth by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State 
John Kerry in December 2016; 
Whereas ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is vital to the 
interests of both parties and the leadership of both par-
ties must negotiate in good faith in order to achieve 
peace; and 
Whereas delays to a political solution to the conflict between 
Israelis and Palestinians pose a threat to the ability to

(1) only the outcome of a two-state solution

the Israelis and the Palestinians can make the dif-
