The Congress finds the following:

•HR 6555 IH
(1) Circulating collectible coin programs are 
1
very popular and generate significant revenue for the 
2
United States Mint (referred to in this Act as the 
3
‘‘Mint’’) to continue as a self-sustaining enterprise 
4
at no cost to the taxpayers. 
5
(2) During the 50 State Quarters Program 
6
(1999–2008), the Mint issued 34.2 billion quarter 
7
dollars into circulation, with an average of 3.4 billion 
8
quarter dollars annually, generating total circulating 
9
and numismatic program revenue of $9.1 billion. 
10
(3) The America the Beautiful Quarters Pro-
11
gram (2010–2021) has generated total program rev-
12
enue of $3.7 billion to date. 
13
(4) Because the America the Beautiful Quar-
14
ters Program is scheduled to be discontinued in 
15
2021, authorizing new circulating collectible coin 
16
programs will contribute to the longevity and long- 
17
term growth of the Mint, serve the public interest, 
18
and deliver substantial revenue to the Mint and the 
19
Department of the Treasury General Fund that oth-
20
erwise may not be realized. 
21
(5) The United States Mint has completed ex-
22
tensive due diligence in evaluating previous circu-
23
lating collectible coin programs and evaluating the 
24
likely success of future efforts.

(6) July 4, 2026, will be the 250th anniversary 
1
of the founding of the United States, with the sign-
2
ing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The 
3
historic events preceding that anniversary— 
4
(A) are of major significance in the devel-
5
opment of the national heritage of the United 
6
States and its principles of individual liberty, 
7
representative government, and the attainment 
8
of equal and inalienable rights; and 
9
(B) 
have 
had 
a 
profound 
influence 
10
throughout the world. 
11
(7) The 114th Congress established the United 
12
States Semiquincentennial Commission to plan, de-
13
velop, and execute programs, projects, and activities 
14
to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the 
15
United States.
