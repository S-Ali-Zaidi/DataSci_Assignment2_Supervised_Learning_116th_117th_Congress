Whereas, in 1972, Mr. Eddie Williams was recruited to lead

ed just 2 years earlier to support the hundreds of new 
Black elected officials who came into office in the after-
math of the Voting Rights Act of 1965;

Joint Center into the epicenter of Black political thought 
and research and hosted Black elected officials every 4 
years to assemble policy priorities to share with Presi-
dential candidates and transition teams; 
Whereas, under the leadership of Mr. Williams, the Joint 
Center helped establish several organizations of Black 
elected officials, built a roster of over 10,000 Black elect-
ed officials, and helped establish the National Coalition 
on Black Civic Participation; 
Whereas Mr. Williams also created Focus Magazine to tie to-
gether Black elected officials, political activists, and 
scholars nationwide;
