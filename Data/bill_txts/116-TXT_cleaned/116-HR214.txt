Whereas, in 2018, 87 countries and areas had ongoing ma-
laria transmissions, including areas of Africa, the Middle

Whereas the Department of Defense reports that a total of 
60 servicemembers were diagnosed with malaria in 2016, 
the highest number since 2011; 
Whereas incidents of malaria were diagnosed at or reported 
from 19 different medical facilities in the United States, 
Afghanistan, Qatar, Germany, Djibouti, Japan, and 
South Korea in 2017; 
Whereas the Department of Defense recognizes malaria as 
the number one infectious disease threat to United States 
military forces; 
Whereas United States support for efforts to fight malaria is 
in the foreign policy and humanitarian interests of the

the United States through the work of governmental, 
nongovernmental, and faith-based organizations of the 
United States that are on the frontlines of the malaria 
battle globally; 
Whereas United States support for efforts to fight malaria 
and other infectious diseases advance the United States 
National Security Strategy, and is a key tool to enhance 
operational readiness, interoperability, and security co-
operation, protecting Americans at home and abroad;

role in the recent progress made toward reducing the

search (WRAIR) has played a leadership role protecting 
United States servicemembers from the world’s most per-
vasive infectious diseases, including malaria, HIV/AIDS, 
Ebola, and dengue; 
Whereas WRAIR Center for Infectious Disease Research has 
been responsible for developing critical Food and Drug 
Administration-approved medicines, vaccines, drugs, and 
other interventions used to prevent malaria, Japanese en-
cephalitis, hepatitis A, adenovirus, and other infectious 
diseases in deployed servicemembers; 
Whereas the WRAIR Malaria Vaccine and Experimental 
Therapeutics Branches have emerged as the Department 
of Defense’s premier effort to develop vaccines and drugs 
to protect the warfighter from malaria and other infec-
tious diseases and military health threats; 
Whereas WRAIR continues to play a leadership role in the 
research and development of lifesaving medicines includ-
ing the recently approved tafenoquine, a radical cure and 
prophylaxis that protects the warfighter from P vivax re-
lapse, a condition that causes approximately 8.5 million 
clinical infections per year worldwide; 
Whereas WRAIR leads the fight against drug-resistant 
strains of malaria, developing new treatments that have 
revolutionized malaria prevention efforts; 
Whereas WRAIR’s international network of laboratories sup-
ports medical diplomacy and fosters United States-host
