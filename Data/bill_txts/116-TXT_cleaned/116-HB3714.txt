(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 3714 IH
(1) On February 14, 2018, 17 individuals lost 
1
their lives in a senseless and violent attack on Mar-
2
jory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, 
3
Florida, a school whose mascot is the eagle. 
4
(2) These individuals lived lives of warmth, joy, 
5
determination, service, and love, and their loss is 
6
mourned by the Nation. 
7
(3) The shooter in that attack exhibited pat-
8
terns of behavior that were alarming and that should 
9
have alerted law enforcement and other Federal, 
10
State, and local officials. 
11
(4) The attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
12
High School was preventable. 
13
(5) Lives were saved because of the brave and 
14
exemplary conduct of many students, teachers, and 
15
staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in-
16
cluding several of the victims of the attack. 
17
(6) The National Threat Assessment Center 
18
(referred to in this Act as the ‘‘Center’’) was estab-
19
lished in 1998 to conduct research on various types 
20
of targeted violence. 
21
(7) Studies conducted by the Center on tar-
22
geted school violence, in particular, have shown 
23
that— 
24
00:19 Jul 20, 2019
H3714
3 
•HR 3714 IH
(A) most incidents were planned in ad-
1
vance; 
2
(B) the attackers’ behavior gave some indi-
3
cation that the individual was planning, or at 
4
least contemplating, an attack; 
5
(C) most attackers had already exhibited a 
6
pattern of behavior that was of concern to other 
7
people in their lives; and 
8
(D) prior to the attack, someone associated 
9
with the attacker, such as a family member or 
10
peer, knew the attack was likely to occur. 
11
(8) Through their research, the Center devel-
12
oped the threat assessment model for responding to 
13
indicators of targeted violence, which includes a 3- 
14
step process— 
15
(A) identifying individuals who are exhib-
16
iting behaviors that indicate they are planning 
17
an attack on a school; 
18
(B) assessing whether the individual poses 
19
a threat to the school, based on articulable 
20
facts; and 
21
(C) managing the threat the individual 
22
may pose to the school. 
23
(9) The threat assessment model works most 
24
effectively when all the relevant parties, including 
25

•HR 3714 IH
school officials, local law enforcement, and members 
1
of the community, are part of a comprehensive pro-
2
tocol to identify, assess, and manage a potential 
3
threat to the school. 
4
(10) The primary goal of threat assessment 
5
programs in schools should be to prevent violent con-
6
duct, with an emphasis on early intervention, treat-
7
ment, and care of individuals exhibiting behaviors 
8
associated with targeted violence. 
9
(11) Early intervention, treatment, and preven-
10
tion of violent behavior is an effective way to prevent 
11
violent conduct that would harm others and neces-
12
sitate disciplinary action, including criminal pen-
13
alties. 
14
(12) The parties involved need the appropriate 
15
training and tools to establish the appropriate mech-
16
anisms for implementing this type of approach. 
17
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
18
gress that a fact-based threat assessment approach, in-
19
volving school officials, local law enforcement, and mem-
20
bers of the community, is one of the most effective ways 
21
to prevent targeted violence in schools, and is a fitting me-
22
morial to those who lost their lives in the February 14, 
23
2018, attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School
