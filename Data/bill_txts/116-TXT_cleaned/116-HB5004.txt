ployees in certain occupations with evidence of unpredict-
able and unstable scheduling practices that negatively 
affect employees, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Schedules That Work Act’’. 
5
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The vast majority of the United States 
7
workforce today is juggling responsibilities at home 
8
and at work. Women are primary breadwinners or 
9
co-breadwinners in 64 percent of families in the 
10
United States. 
11
(2) Despite the dual responsibilities of today’s 
12
workforce, both hourly and salaried workers often 
13
have little ability to make changes to their work 
14
schedules when those changes are needed to accom-
15
modate family responsibilities. 
16
(3)(A) Mothers working in low-wage jobs are 
17
more likely to be the primary or sole breadwinner for 
18
their families than mothers working in higher-wage 
19
jobs. For example, nearly 7 in 10 mothers in the 
20
one-fifth of households in the United States with the 
21
lowest incomes bring home all or most of their fami-
22

•HR 5004 IH
lies’ income, compared to less than one-third of their 
1
counterparts in the highest-income quintile. 
2
(B) At the same time, low-wage workers have 
3
the least control over their work schedules and the 
4
most unpredictable schedules. Across industries, 
5
more than half (55 percent) of low-paid hourly work-
6
ers report that they receive a week or less of notice 
7
of their work schedules, and nearly two-thirds (65 
8
percent) report that their employer controls the tim-
9
ing of their work hours. In some industries, ‘‘just- 
10
in-time’’ scheduling practices, which base workers’ 
11
schedules on perceived consumer demand to mini-
12
mize labor costs, are particularly common. Employ-
13
ers using these practices often post work schedules 
14
with little notice, vary work hours widely from week 
15
to week, cancel shifts at the last minute, and sched-
16
ule employees for ‘‘on call’’ shifts (requiring an em-
17
ployee to call in to work to find out whether the em-
18
ployee will have to work later that day) or 
19
‘‘clopening’’ shifts (requiring an employee to work a 
20
closing shift at night followed by an opening shift a 
21
few hours later). For example, surveys of nearly 
22
30,000 hourly workers employed by the 80 largest 
23
retail and food service chains in the United States 
24
show that— 
25
02:02 Nov 19, 2019
H5004
4 
•HR 5004 IH
(i) about two-thirds of hourly retail and 
1
food service workers receive their work sched-
2
ules with less than 2 weeks’ advance notice; 
3
(ii) more than one in 4 hourly retail and 
4
food service workers have been scheduled for 
5
on-call shifts, and half have worked ‘‘clopening’’ 
6
shifts; and 
7
(iii) only one in 5 hourly retail and food 
8
service workers report working a regular day-
9
time schedule. 
10
(4) Unfair work scheduling practices make it 
11
difficult for low-wage workers to— 
12
(A) provide necessary care for children and 
13
other family members, including securing and 
14
maintaining stable child care; 
15
(B) access and receive needed care for the 
16
workers’ own serious health conditions; 
17
(C) pursue workforce training; 
18
(D) get or keep a second job, which many 
19
workers need to make ends meet; 
20
(E) plan for and access transportation to 
21
reach worksites; and 
22
(F) qualify for and maintain eligibility for 
23
needed public benefits and work supports, such 
24
as child care subsidies and benefits under the 
25

•HR 5004 IH
supplemental nutrition assistance program, due 
1
to fluctuations in income and work hours. 
2
(5) A growing body of research demonstrates 
3
that unstable and unpredictable work schedules have 
4
significant detrimental impacts on sleep quality, 
5
mental health, and happiness, and are associated 
6
with unstable child care arrangements and negative 
7
health and behavioral outcomes for children. These 
8
work schedules—and the work-family conflict they 
9
produce—are also associated with higher rates of 
10
turnover, which creates further instability for em-
11
ployers and workers. Workers of color are also more 
12
likely than their White counterparts, even compared 
13
to White coworkers at the same company, to experi-
14
ence unstable work schedules. For example: 
15
(A) Unstable work schedules lead to more 
16
household economic strain and time conflicts, 
17
and hurt the well-being of parents. While 
18
household economic strain, time conflicts, and 
19
the well-being of parents may all negatively im-
20
pact the health and behavior of a child, a par-
21
ent’s well-being is the most significant factor in 
22
determining the behavior and health outcomes 
23
of a child. The more severe the work schedule 
24
02:02 Nov 19, 2019
H5004
6 
•HR 5004 IH
instability, the worse the child’s behavior and 
1
health outcomes. 
2
(B) The exposure of a parent to on-call 
3
shifts and last-minute shift changes are associ-
4
ated with more unstable child care arrange-
5
ments and with the use of siblings to provide 
6
care. 
7
(C) Work schedule instability causes more 
8
work-family conflict, which increases the chance 
9
that a worker will be forced to leave his or her 
10
job. This turnover is associated with downward 
11
mobility of the worker’s earnings. 
12
(D)(i) Relative to White workers, workers 
13
of color are more likely to— 
14
(I) have cancelled shifts; 
15
(II) have on-call shifts; 
16
(III) be involuntary part-time work-
17
ers; 
18
(IV) have trouble getting time off; 
19
and 
20
(V) work ‘‘clopening’’ shifts, as de-
21
scribed in paragraph (3)(B). 
22
(ii) The statistics described in clause (i) re-
23
main true after controlling for demographics, 
24
human capital, worker power, firm segregation, 
25
02:02 Nov 19, 2019

•HR 5004 IH
and discordance with the race or ethnicity of 
1
the worker and the manager. Race gaps in job 
2
quality are greater for women of color. 
3
(E) Workers who receive shorter advanced 
4
notice, those who work on-call shifts, those who 
5
experience last minute shift cancellation and 
6
timing changes, and those with more volatile 
7
work hours are more likely to experience hun-
8
ger, residential hardships, and more overall eco-
9
nomic hardship. 
10
(6) Unpredictable and unstable work schedules 
11
are common in a wide range of occupations, with 
12
evidence of particular concentration in food service, 
13
retail, cleaning, hospitality, and warehouse occupa-
14
tions. These occupations are critically important to 
15
the United States economy. 
16
(7) Employers that have implemented fair work 
17
scheduling policies that allow workers to have more 
18
control over their work schedules, and provide more 
19
predictable and stable schedules, have experienced 
20
significant benefits, including reductions in absentee-
21
ism and workforce turnover, and increased worker 
22
morale and engagement. For example, when Gap 
23
Inc. piloted strategies to make work schedules more 
24
stable and predictable for employees, the Gap Inc. 
25
02:02 Nov 19, 2019

stores that implemented these strategies experienced 
1
higher productivity, and a 7-percent increase in 
2
sales, compared to those Gap Inc. stores that did not 
3
implement these strategies. 
4
(8) This Act is a first step in responding to the 
5
needs of workers for a voice in the timing of their 
6
work hours and for more predictable schedules.
