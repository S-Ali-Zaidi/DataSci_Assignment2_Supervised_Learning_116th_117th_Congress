SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Since the onset of airborne naval military 
3
training in Nevada as early as 1944, residents of the 
4
Silver State have coped with the direct and indirect 
5
effects of training overflights. 
6
22:37 Jun 08, 2020
H6889
6 
•HR 6889 IH
(2) Such effects are heard, seen, and felt most 
1
acutely near the bases and bombing ranges dedi-
2
cated to furthering the United States military’s mis-
3
sion interests, but extend more than 100 miles be-
4
yond, for example, Naval Air Station Fallon. 
5
(3) Additionally, Nevadans who live and work 
6
beneath dedicated air training routes throughout 
7
central, north-central, and northwestern Nevada live 
8
with persistent noise and periodic disruptions related 
9
to training activities day and night. 
10
(4) Although direct impacts of military training 
11
are centered in Churchill County to the north, east, 
12
and south of Fallon, adjoining counties also com-
13
monly endure both high- and low-level overflights. 
14
Pershing, Lander Nye, Mineral, Washoe, and Lyon 
15
counties shoulder much of this burden. 
16
(5) Providing for the common sense rationaliza-
17
tion of the 19th century checkerboard land-owner-
18
ship and public interest conveyances of land, for ex-
19
ample, for fire stations, airports, and municipal 
20
parks, represents reasonable mitigation for ongoing 
21
impacts to Nevada’s communities. 
22
(6) The Fallon Range Training Complex and 
23
Naval Air Station Fallon’s economic, environmental, 
24
and community impacts are seen throughout all of

(7) On April 15, 2020, the Churchill County 
4
Board of Commissioners passed a resolution sup-
5
porting legislation to address and mitigate the 
6
Navy’s Record of Decision through the National De-
7

14

17

18
