Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

4
Needs to Know Act’’.

(1) The National Instant Criminal Background 
1
Check System (NICS), which is used to conduct 
2
background checks on individuals as they purchase 
3
a gun from federally licensed firearms dealers, pro-
4
vides a one-time snapshot view of an individual’s 
5
criminal history status. It does not, however, provide 
6
notice to Federal, State, or local law enforcement of-
7
ficials if a firearm owner later falls into a category 
8
of people prohibited by law from possessing fire-
9
arms. 
10
(2) Law enforcement should be notified when a 
11
firearm license or permit holder loses his or her legal 
12
eligibility for the license or permit through criminal 
13
activity anywhere in the country. 
14
(3) The Rap Back Service is a capability of the 
15
Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Next Generation 
16
Identification (NGI) system. The Rap Back Service 
17
provides notice to authorized agencies of activity of 
18
licensed individuals that might impact their contin-
19
ued eligibility for a license. Enrollment in the Rap 
20
Back Service eliminates the need for repeated back-
21
ground checks on a person in order to determine 
22
whether they continue to be eligible for their license. 
23
(4) In 2012, the Government Accountability Of-
24
fice issued a report based on a survey of State con-
25

cealed carry permitting systems. The report found 
1
that 6 of the 9 States surveyed used in-State rap 
2
back services to monitor the continued eligibility of 
3
concealed carry permitholders. The report also found 
4
that the FBI’s nationwide Rap Back Service may 
5
provide States with ‘‘the opportunity to subscribe to 
6
this service and automatically be notified of subse-
7
quent arrests across the United States for crimes 
8
committed by permit holders.’’.
