SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REP-
1
RESENTATIVES. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that: 
3
(1) Caregiving is an essential element of family 
4
life and a vital service for children, the ill, the dis-
5
abled, and the elderly. 
6
(2) The establishment of a caregiver credit 
7
would bolster the economic prospects of unpaid care-
8
givers and would provide them with vital retirement 
9
security. 
10
(3) The 2018 Annual Report of the Board of 
11
Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors In-
12
surance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust 
13
Funds concluded that the combined Trust Funds 
14
will be able to pay scheduled benefits in full until 
15
2034. 
16
(b) SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.— 
17
It is the sense of House of Representatives that the United 
18
States Congress must address the unfair exclusion of pro-
19
fessional and hardworking home care providers who are 
20
not eligible to receive Social Security or Medicare because 
21
they provide paid care to a family member with a disability 
22
under programs operated at the State and local level for 
23
general health and welfare protection.
