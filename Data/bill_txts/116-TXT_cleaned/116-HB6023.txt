(1) Composting is one of the most environ-
1
mentally friendly means to dispose of food waste and 
2
other organic wastes.

(2) Composting not only causes less nutrient 
4
pollution of surface and ground water and emits a 
5
smaller quantity of greenhouse gases compared to 
6
alternative disposal methods, but also yields a valu-
7
able soil amendment that enhances soil health and 
8
fertility and agricultural resilience to the impacts of 
9
climate change. 
10
(3) It is critical for the Natural Resources Con-
11
servation Service to provide technical and financial 
12
support to producers in the on-farm production of 
13
compost from on-farm and off-farm organic byprod-
14
ucts, and the utilization of compost in accordance 
15
with sound soil health and nutrition management.
