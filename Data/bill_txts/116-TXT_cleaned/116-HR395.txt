RESOLUTION 
Condemning the senseless attacks on hospitals and medical 
personnel in Syria, and for other purposes. 
Whereas health facilities and medical workers are systemati-
cally targeted in Syria; 
Whereas since 2011, there have been more than 550 attacks 
on medical facilities in Syria and more than 890 medical 
personnel, including 250 volunteers from the Syrian Civil 
Defense, also known as the White Helmets; 
Whereas Physicians for Human Rights reports that 90 per-
cent of the attacks against hospitals and medical per-
sonnel were conducted by the Government of Syria and 
the Russian Federation;

Whereas the Government of Syria and the Russian Federa-
tion deliberately and strategically target medical facili-
tates and first responders to maximize casualties; 
Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Anto´nio Guterres 
stated, ‘‘These attacks are evidence of a broader trend: 
parties to conflict are treating hospitals and health clinics 
as targets, rather than respecting them as sanctuaries.’’; 
Whereas there are specific obligations under international hu-
manitarian law to respect and protect, in situations of 
armed conflict, medical personnel and humanitarian per-
sonnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means 
of transport and equipment, and hospitals and other 
medical facilities; 
Whereas there is an obligation under international humani-
tarian law to distinguish between civilian populations and 
combatants, and the prohibition against indiscriminate 
attacks, and the obligations to do everything feasible to 
verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civil-
ians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special 
protection, including medical personnel, their means of 
transport and equipment, and hospitals and other med-
ical facilities; 
Whereas under international humanitarian law, persons en-
gaged in medical activities shall not be compelled to per-
form acts or to carry out work contrary to the rules of 
medical ethics or to other medical rules designed for the 
benefit of the wounded and the sick; 
Whereas these acts of violence, attacks, and threats against 
medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively 
engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and 
equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facili-

ties, and obstructing the delivery of humanitarian assist-
ance, including medical assistance, may exacerbate ongo-
ing armed conflicts and undermine the efforts of medical 
personnel and humanitarian personnel; 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council adopted Reso-
lution 2286 on May 3, 2016, which demands that, ‘‘all 
parties to armed conflict fully comply with their obliga-
tion under international law, including international 
human rights law, as applicable, and international hu-
manitarian law . . . to ensure the respect and protection 
of all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel ex-
clusively engaged in medical duties, their means of trans-
port and equipment, as well as hospitals and other med-
ical facilities’’; 
Whereas any deliberate attack on civilians in Syria by all par-
ties constitutes a major violation of international law and 
undermines efforts to stop the bloodshed and reach a 
lasting, internationally negotiated peace through the Ge-
neva and Vienna process; and 
Whereas the rate of attacks perpetrated on healthcare per-
sonnel have continued to increase dramatically: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

2
medical personnel, and emergency responders by the

Government of Syria and the Russian Federation;

as well as hospitals and other medical facilities in

armed conflict, and, where appropriate, take action 
13
against those with a view to reinforce preventive 
14
measures, ensuring accountability, and addressing 
15
the grievances of victims in Syria; and 
16
(4) requests the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster

Assistance to conduct a feasibility study on the con-
