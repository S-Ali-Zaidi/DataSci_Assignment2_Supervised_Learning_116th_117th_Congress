A BILL 
To set forth the policy of the United States regarding 
vandalism, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. PURPOSE. 
3
The purpose of this Act is as follows: 
4
(1) The first duty of government is to ensure 
5
domestic tranquility and defend the life, property, 
6
and rights of its citizens. Recently, there has been 
7

•HR 7643 IH
a sustained assault on the life and property of civil-
1
ians, law enforcement officers, government property, 
2
and revered American monuments such as the Lin-
3
coln Memorial. Many of the rioters, arsonists, and 
4
extremists who have carried out and supported these 
5
acts have explicitly identified themselves with 
6
ideologies—such as Marxism—that call for the de-
7
struction of the United States system of govern-
8
ment. 
9
(2) Anarchists and extremists have sought to 
10
advance a fringe ideology that paints the United 
11
States of America as fundamentally unjust and have 
12
sought to impose that ideology on Americans 
13
through violence and mob intimidation. They have 
14
led riots in the streets, burned police vehicles, killed 
15
and assaulted government officers as well as busi-
16
ness owners defending their property, and even 
17
seized an area within one city where law and order 
18
gave way to anarchy. During the unrest, innocent 
19
citizens also have been harmed and killed. 
20
(3) These criminal acts are frequently planned 
21
and supported by agitators who have traveled across 
22
State lines to promote their own violent agenda. 
23
These radicals shamelessly attack the legitimacy of 
24
our institutions and the very rule of law itself.

(4) Key targets in the violent extremists’ cam-
1
paign against our country are public monuments, 
2
memorials, and statues. Their selection of targets re-
3
veals a deep ignorance of our history, and is indic-
4
ative of a desire to indiscriminately destroy anything 
5
that honors our past and to erase from the public 
6
mind any suggestion that our past may be worth 
7
honoring, 
cherishing, 
remembering, 
or 
under-
8
standing. For example, vandals toppled a statue of 
9
President Ulysses S. Grant in San Francisco. To 
10
them, it made no difference that President Grant led 
11
the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy in 
12
the Civil War, enforced Reconstruction, fought the 
13
Ku Klux Klan, and advocated for the Fifteenth 
14
Amendment, which guaranteed freed slaves the right 
15
to vote. In Charlotte, North Carolina, the names of 
16
507 veterans memorialized on a World War II 
17
monument were painted over with a symbol of com-
18
munism. In Boston, a memorial commemorating an 
19
African-American regiment that fought in the Civil 
20
War was defaced with graffiti. In Madison, Wis-
21
consin, rioters knocked over the statue of an aboli-
22
tionist immigrant who fought for the Union during 
23
the Civil War. Christian figures are now in the 
24
crosshairs, too. Recently, an influential activist for 
25

one movement that has been prominent in setting 
1
the agenda for demonstrations in recent weeks de-
2
clared that many existing religious depictions of 
3
Jesus and the Holy Family should be purged from 
4
our places of worship. 
5
(5) Individuals and organizations have the right 
6
to peacefully advocate for either the removal or the 
7
construction of any monument. But no individual or 
8
group has the right to damage, deface, or remove 
9
any monument by use of force. 
10
(6) In the midst of these attacks, many State 
11
and local governments appear to have lost the ability 
12
to distinguish between the lawful exercise of rights 
13
to free speech and assembly and unvarnished van-
14
dalism. They have surrendered to mob rule, imper-
15
iling community safety, allowing for the wholesale 
16
violation of our laws, and privileging the violent im-
17
pulses of the mob over the rights of law-abiding citi-
18
zens. Worse, they apparently have lost the will or 
19
the desire to stand up to the radical fringe and de-
20
fend the fundamental truth that America is good, 
21
her people are virtuous, and that justice prevails in 
22
this country to a far greater extent than anywhere 
23
else in the world. Some particularly misguided public 
24
officials even appear to have accepted the idea that 
25
05:45 Aug 05, 2020

•HR 7643 IH
violence can be virtuous and have prevented their 
1
police from enforcing the law and protecting public 
2
monuments, memorials, and statues from the mob’s 
3
ropes and graffiti.

SEC. 2. POLICY. 
5
(a) It is the policy of the United States to prosecute 
6
to the fullest extent permitted under Federal law, and as 
7
appropriate, any person or any entity that destroys, dam-
8
ages, vandalizes, or desecrates a monument, memorial, or 
9
statue within the United States or otherwise vandalizes 
10
government property. The desire of the Congress to pro-
11
tect Federal property is clearly reflected in section 1361 
12
of title 18, United States Code, which authorizes a penalty 
13
of up to 10 years’ imprisonment for the willful injury of 
14
Federal property. More recently, under the Veterans’ Me-
15
morial Preservation and Recognition Act of 2003, section 
16
1369 of title 18, United States Code, the Congress pun-
17
ished with the same penalties the destruction of Federal 
18
and in some cases State-maintained monuments that 
19
honor military veterans. Other criminal statutes, such as 
20
the Travel Act, section 1952 of title 18, United States 
21
Code, permit prosecutions of arson damaging monuments, 
22
memorials, and statues on State grounds in some cases. 
23
Civil statutes like the Public System Resource Protection 
24
Act, section 100722 of title 54, United States Code, also

hold those who destroy certain Federal property account-
1
able for their offenses. The Federal Government will not 
2
tolerate violations of these and other laws. 
3
(b) It is the policy of the United States to prosecute 
4
to the fullest extent permitted under Federal law, and as 
5
appropriate, any person or any entity that participates in 
6
efforts to incite violence or other illegal activity in connec-
7
tion with the riots and acts of vandalism described in sec-
8
tion 1. Numerous Federal laws, including section 2101 of 
9
title 18, United States Code, prohibit the violence that has 
10
typified the past few weeks in some cities. Other statutes 
11
punish those who participate in or assist the agitators who 
12
have coordinated these lawless acts. Such laws include sec-
13
tion 371 of title 18, United States Code, which criminal-
14
izes certain conspiracies to violate Federal law, section 2 
15
of title 18, United States Code, which punishes those who 
16
aid or abet the commission of Federal crimes, and section 
17
2339A of title 18, United States Code, which prohibits 
18
as material support to terrorism efforts to support a de-
19
fined set of Federal crimes. Those who have joined in re-
20
cent violent acts around the United States will be held 
21
accountable. 
22
(c) It is the policy of the United States to prosecute 
23
to the fullest extent permitted under Federal law, and as 
24
appropriate, any person or any entity that damages, de-

faces, or destroys religious property, including by attack-
1
ing, removing, or defacing depictions of Jesus or other re-
2
ligious figures or religious art work. Federal laws prohibit, 
3
under certain circumstances, damage or defacement of re-
4
ligious property, including the Church Arson Prevention 
5
Act of 1996, section 247 of title 18, United States Code, 
6
and section 371 of title 18, United States Code. The Fed-
7
eral Government will not tolerate violations of these laws 
8
designed to protect the free exercise of religion. 
9
(d) It is the policy of the United States, as appro-
10
priate and consistent with applicable law, to withhold Fed-
11
eral support tied to public spaces from State and local gov-
12
ernments that have failed to protect public monuments, 
13
memorials, and statues from destruction or vandalism. 
14
These jurisdictions’ recent abandonment of their law en-
15
forcement responsibilities with respect to public monu-
16
ments, memorials, and statues casts doubt on their will-
17
ingness to protect other public spaces and maintain the 
18
peace within them. These jurisdictions are not appropriate 
19
candidates for limited Federal funds that support public 
20
spaces. 
21
(e) It is the policy of the United States, as appro-
22
priate and consistent with applicable law, to withhold Fed-
23
eral support from State and local law enforcement agen-
24
cies that have failed to protect public monuments, memo-

rials, and statues from destruction or vandalism. Unwill-
1
ingness to enforce State and local laws in the face of at-
2
tacks on our history, whether because of sympathy for the 
3
extremists behind this violence or some other improper 
4
reason, casts doubt on the management of these law en-
5
forcement agencies. These law enforcement agencies are 
6
not appropriate candidates for limited Federal funds that 
7
support State and local police.
