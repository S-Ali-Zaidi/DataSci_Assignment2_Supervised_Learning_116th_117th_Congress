•HR 1107 IH
(1) Judge Neringa Venckiene fled to the United 
1
States in 2013 and requested political asylum after 
2
a 5-year battle in Lithuania to secure justice for her 
3
4-year-old niece, Deimante Kedyte, who reported 
4
that she was being sexually molested by Lithuanian 
5
government officials while in her mother’s care. 
6
(2) Deimante Kedyte’s claims of sexual moles-
7
tation were evaluated by court-ordered psychologists 
8
and psychiatrists and deemed to be credible. 
9
(3) Deimante Kedyte accused of sexual molesta-
10
tion her mother and 2 associates of her mother, an 
11
assistant to the Speaker of the Parliament and a sit-
12
ting judge. 
13
(4) Judge Venckiene and Deimante Kedyte’s fa-
14
ther petitioned law enforcement and the courts for 
15
full investigation of Deimante’s claims against the 
16
accused individuals, but believed the ensuing inves-
17
tigation to be negligent. 
18
(5) Lithuania’s parliament (Legal and Judici-
19
ary Committees) issued a report in 2010 that 
20
deemed the investigation into Deimante Kedyte’s 
21
sexual molestation accusations to be negligent and 
22
found that the negligence had compromised the case 
23
against the public officials.

•HR 1107 IH
(6) The prosecutors in the case were fired be-
1
cause, according to the court, their negligence in the 
2
investigation and overt coordination with one of the 
3
suspects resulted in possible lost evidence and cre-
4
ated ‘‘circumstances for the suspects to avoid crimi-
5
nal liability’’. 
6
(7) The Child’s Rights Ombudsman was fired. 
7
(8) The then Attorney General of Lithaunia, 
8
Algimantas Valantinas, as well as multiple prosecu-
9
tors, were forced to resign. 
10
(9) After Deimante Kedyte’s father went miss-
11
ing in 2009, Judge Venckiene was awarded guard-
12
ianship of Deimante. 
13
(10) Deimante Kedyte’s mother was never in-
14
dicted for complicity in the sexual molestation de-
15
spite a Vilnius District Court Ruling in October 
16
2009 that there was enough evidence to indict her. 
17
(11) In December 2011, Judge Venckiene was 
18
ordered to give Deimante Kedyte, then 7 years old, 
19
back to her mother, but Deimante refused to return 
20
to her mother, indicating fear of sexual molestation. 
21
(12) Hundreds of Lithuanians kept vigil outside 
22
Judge Venckiene’s house to prevent the Lithuanian 
23
Government from removing Deimante Kedyte.

•HR 1107 IH
(13) In May 2012, the Lithuanian Government 
1
sent more than 200 police officers to take Deimante 
2
Kedyte from Judge Venckiene by force. 
3
(14) 
Deimante 
Kedyte 
clung 
to 
Judge 
4
Venckiene, was ripped from her, was carried away 
5
shrieking, and has completely disappeared from pub-
6
lic view for the last 61⁄2 years. 
7
(15) The Lithuanian Government’s action re-
8
sulted in protests against the Lithuanian Govern-
9
ment in Lithuania and at numerous Lithuanian em-
10
bassies around the world, as well as in the United 
11
States when the Lithuanian President attended the 
12
NATO summit in Chicago in May 2012. 
13
(16) Judge Venckiene published a book entitled 
14
‘‘Way of Courage’’ in 2012 about Deimante 
15
Kedyte’s ordeal and Lithuania’s failure to properly 
16
investigate and prosecute the case against the gov-
17
ernment officials. 
18
(17) ‘‘Way of Courage’’ became the name of a 
19
new, anti-corruption, anti-pedophilia political party 
20
in Lithuania, which elected Judge Venckiene to 
21
Lithuania’s parliament in 2012. 
22
(18) Judge Venckiene sought political asylum in 
23
the United States in 2013 after she received threats 
24
and experienced what she believed was an attempt 
25

on her life following a political rally, and after the 
1
Lithuanian 
Government 
moved 
to 
lift 
Judge 
2
Venckiene’s parliamentary immunity. 
3
(19) The Lithuanian Government has system-
4
atically prosecuted for ‘‘false statements’’ and other 
5
crimes the journalists, a medical professional, 
6
Deimante Kedyte’s grandparents, Judge Venckiene’s 
7
neighbor, other members of her new political party, 
8
people who attended rallies on her behalf, and many 
9
others who came forward with evidence or support of 
10
Deimante Kedyte’s claims of sexual molestation or 
11
who opposed the violent removal of Deimante from 
12
Judge Venckiene. 
13
(20) Lithuania has leveled more than 35 
14
charges against Judge Venckiene, including charges 
15
for filing petitions on behalf of Deimante Kedyte 
16
with Lithuania’s courts and the Child’s Rights Om-
17
budsman, making statements critical of the inves-
18
tigation to journalists, describing in her book the 
19
sexual molestation case against and naming the pub-
20
lic officials, involvement in ‘‘unauthorized protests’’, 
21
‘‘humiliating the court’’, desecrating the national an-
22
them, conducting her own investigation into the 
23
case, failing to turn Deimante over to the accused 
24
mother, 
bruising 
an 
officer, 
and 
kicking

Deimante’s accused mother when the accused moth-
1
er tried to remove Deimante. 
2
(21) The extradition treaty signed by the 
3
United States and the Republic of Lithuania on Oc-
4
tober 23, 2001, does not permit for Judge Venckiene 
5
to offer counter-evidence in United States court to 
6
any of Lithuania’s charges against her or to make 
7
the case for Lithuania’s political motivation. 
8
(22) A United States Magistrate Judge in April 
9
2018 approved extradition for charges that Judge 
10
Venckiene hindered the activities of a bailiff, failed 
11
to comply with a court’s decision not associated with 
12
a penalty, caused physical pain, and resisted against 
13
a civil servant or a person performing the functions 
14
of public administration—all charges related to 
15
Deimante Kedyte violently being taken from Judge 
16
Venckiene’s home and returned to the accused moth-
17
er. 
18
(23) In October 2017, Lithuanian prosecutor in 
19
the case, D. Jakutis, explained to news outlet 
20
Lietuvos Rytas that political charges were inten-
21
tionally removed from the extradition request so that 
22
the request would not be rejected by United States 
23
authorities. He also noted that if Judge Venckiene 
24

•HR 1107 IH
is returned to Lithuania, new charges related to the 
1
old case could be added. 
2
(24) Former political prisoners, current and 
3
former government officials in Lithuania, as well as 
4
other prominent members of society in Lithuania, 
5
have written to the United States Government, 
6
warning that the Lithuanian Government’s charges 
7
against Judge Venckiene are politically motivated. 
8
(25) The Chairman of the Supreme Court of 
9
Lithuania Gintaras Kryzevicius has been reported as 
10
publicly saying that Judge Venckiene ‘‘is an abscess 
11
in the legal system and an abscess in the political 
12
system’’ and ‘‘the trouble of the whole state’’. 
13
(26) Finland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Den-
14
mark, Israel, Germany, Austria, Malta, Ukraine, 
15
and Russia have all refused to extradite individuals 
16
to Lithuania. 
17
(27) Judge Venckiene can present evidence con-
18
cerning the political motivation of Lithuania’s 
19
charges against her before an immigration judge if 
20
she is excluded from the extradition treaty and al-
21
lowed to proceed with her political asylum case, filed 
22
in 2013 and scheduled to be heard in July 2019.
