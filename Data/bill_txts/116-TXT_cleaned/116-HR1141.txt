RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 22, 
2020, as ‘‘National Hispanic Nurses Day’’. 
Whereas the World Health Organization declared 2020 as the 
year of the Nurse and Midwife, and coincidentally, 2020 
is experiencing unprecedented times highlighting the in-
telligence, agility, grit, and tenacity of nurses in all sec-
tors across the Nation; 
Whereas a special group of nurses in the Nation are the His-
panic nurses;

Whereas Hispanic nurses provide culturally and ethnically 
competent care and are educated to be sensitive to re-
gional and community customs of persons needing care; 
Whereas Hispanic nurses are well-positioned to provide lead-
ership to eliminate health care disparities that exist in 
the Nation; 
Whereas, since 1975, the National Association of Hispanic 
Nurses (NAHN) has represented Hispanic nurses (RNs/ 
LPNs) in the United States and is the only nursing orga-
nization for Hispanic nurses whose mission is to advance 
the health in Hispanic communities and to lead, promote, 
and advocate for educational, professional, and leadership 
opportunities for Hispanic nurses; 
Whereas, since September is the month that has been set 
aside to honor the contributions of Hispanics, it is only 
fitting that Hispanic nurses be recognized and honored 
during this time for their outstanding contributions to 
their community and country; 
Whereas the designation of an observation day will help to 
raise awareness of the accomplishments of Hispanic 
nurses and pave the way for the important work that 
they must continue to carry out; 
Whereas, each February, NAHN convenes nearly 100 nurs-
ing leaders from academia, research, education, and prac-
tice in Washington, DC, for a Day on Capitol Hill pro-
moting legislation that improves the health of Hispanic 
communities; 
Whereas Hispanic nurses are strong allies to Congress as 
they help inform, educate, and work closely with legisla-
tors to improve the education, retention, recruitment, and

practice of all nurses and, more importantly, the health 
and safety of the patients they care for; and 
Whereas Hispanic nurses add needed diversity to the profes-
sion, and these nurses have engaged in numerous ways 
to support community and needs of an overlooked, under 
resourced, and underserved population being severely im-
pacted by COVID–19: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals, and the des-

ignation, of National Hispanic Nurses Day, as pro-

posed by the National Association of Hispanic 
4
Nurses;

(2) recognizes the significant contributions of

Hispanic nurses to the health care system of the

(3) encourages the people of the United States 
9
to observe National Hispanic Nurses Day with ap-
10
propriate recognition, ceremonies, activities, and pro-
11
grams to demonstrate the importance of Hispanic 
12
nurses to the everyday lives of patients and commu-
13
nities they serve.
