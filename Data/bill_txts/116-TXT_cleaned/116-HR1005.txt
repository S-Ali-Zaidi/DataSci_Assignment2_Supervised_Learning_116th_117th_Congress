RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives 
regarding the enhancement of unity in America. 
Whereas, on June 18, 2015, the United States Supreme 
Court correctly concluded in Walker III v. Texas Divi-
sion, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc. (No. 14–144; 
576 U.S., 135 S. Ct. 2239) that messages on State li-
cense plates constitute ‘‘government speech’’, not private 
speech protected by the First Amendment; 
Whereas the Court also held that it is within the authority 
of a State such as Texas to reject messages on State- 
issued license plates, such as a depiction of the Confed-
erate battle flag, that offend the sensibilities of its citi-

ment property, which constitute ‘‘government speech’’, 
convey the vestiges of the history of slavery that has di-
vided the United States; 
Whereas the role of government is to promote equal protec-
tion under the Constitution and combat fear, oppression, 
and intimidation; 
Whereas these divisive symbols have historically targeted and 
perpetuated fear, oppression, and intimidation of certain 
groups of Americans; 
Whereas the continued existence of these divisive symbols as 
‘‘government speech’’ is also a denial of equal protection 
under the law; 
Whereas the United States can only be a perfect union where 
all are and feel equally protected under the law; and 
Whereas equal protection under the law promotes a more per-
fect union, fairness, tolerance, peace, and a sense of com-
munity oneness, all unalienable rights enshrined in the 
Constitution: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
