10
The Congress finds as follows: 
11
(1) Presidential travel to commercial entities 
12
owned in whole or in part by the President or First 
13
Family results in the American taxpayer effectively 
14
subsidizing the President’s businesses.

(2) Given current expenditures, President 
1
Trump is on track to spend more during his first 
2
year of office than all eight years of the Obama ad-
3
ministration combined. 
4
(3) It is unacceptable for the President to 
5
maintain an interest in traveling to properties in 
6
which he has a direct financial interest, as the U.S. 
7
Government is responsible for renting space for per-
8
sonnel in said private commercial entities. 
9
(4) Every time the President travels to Mar-a- 
10
Lago, he necessarily promotes his private business 
11
interests via free press at the Government’s expense. 
12
(5) The State Department’s recent promotion 
13
of Mar-a-Lago on its official website raises serious 
14
ethics concerns. 
15
(6) As of April 14, 2017, President Trump has 
16
cost the U.S. taxpayer unprecedented amounts of 
17
money, including the following estimated costs: 
18
(A) For trips to Mar-a-Lago: 
19
(i) Total cost for security in Palm 
20
Beach: $3,700,000 (each trip). 
21
(ii) Roundtrip flights from Joint Base 
22
Andrews, Maryland, to West Palm, Flor-

(i) Request for additional Secret Serv-
9
ice funding to secure Trump Towers: 
10
$60,000,000.

(ii) New York Police Department se-
12
curity costs: $127,000–$146,000/day.

(iii) ‘‘Elevator services’’ ordered by 
14
the Secret Service: $64,000. 
15
(iv) Air Force One flights to New 
16

17
(7) The proposed 2017 Federal spending bill in-
18
cludes reimbursements for millions of dollars spent 
19
by Florida and New York to protect the President 
20
and First Family, and facilitate their travel. While 
21
localities should be reimbursed, the taxpayer should 
22
not be responsible for said reimbursement.

SEC. 132. FINDINGS. 
9
Congress finds the following: 
10
(1) Kleptocracy is a tool used by autocratic 
11
leaders, including Vladimir Putin, to exploit state re-
12
sources; it involves the operation of sophisticated 
13
networks for the purpose of self-enrichment. 
14
(2) Unlike prior presidents, President Trump 
15
has refused to sell his business interests or divest 
16
himself of assets that present potential conflicts of 
17
interest. 
18
(3) Article I of the Constitution states that ‘‘no 
19
Person holding any office of profit or trust under 
20
them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, ac-
21
cept any present, emolument, office, or title, of any 
22
kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign

(4) Foreign governments and foreign-held com-
1
panies have already shifted business to the Presi-
2
dent’s companies in order to curry favor with the 
3
Administration. 
4
(5) According to reports, the Trump Inter-
5
national Hotel has generated at least $19,700,000 in 
6
income for the President between September 2016 
7
and April 2017. 
8
(6) The National Security Council and State 
9
Department have allegedly used taxpayers’ money to 
10
pay for staff to stay at Trump hotels and resorts, 
11
thereby benefitting the President. 
12
SEC. 133. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. 
13
It is the sense of Congress that— 
14
(1) kleptocrats such as Vladimir Putin pose a 
15
threat to United States national security by under-
16
mining financial and Government institutions; 
17
(2) the United States must take all steps nec-
18
essary to defend itself against kleptocratic practices; 
19
and 
20
(3) Federal funds should not be expended in a 
21
manner that enriches the President or any of his 
22
close relatives or associates.
