SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) On June 1, 2016, the Department of the 
8
Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
9
announced a Notice of Finding that the Democratic 
10

•HR 4084 IH
People’s Republic of Korea is a jurisdiction of pri-
1
mary money laundering concern due to its use of 
2
state-controlled financial institutions and front com-
3
panies to support the proliferation and development 
4
of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic 
5
missiles. 
6
(2) The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 
7
has expressed serious concerns with the threat posed 
8
by North Korea’s proliferation and financing of 
9
WMD, and has called on FATF members to apply 
10
effective counter-measures to protect their financial 
11
sectors from North Korean money laundering, WMD 
12
proliferation financing, and the financing of ter-
13
rorism. 
14
(3) In its February 2017 report, the U.N. 
15
Panel of Experts concluded that— 
16
(A) North Korea continued to access the 
17
international financial system in support of il-
18
licit activities despite sanctions imposed by 
19
U.N. Security Council Resolutions 2270 (2016) 
20
and 2321 (2016); 
21
(B) during the reporting period, no mem-
22
ber state had reported taking actions to freeze 
23
North Korean assets; and 
24
22:14 Aug 14, 2019
H4084
3 
•HR 4084 IH
(C) sanctions evasion by North Korea, 
1
combined with inadequate compliance by mem-
2
ber states, had significantly negated the impact 
3
of U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
4
(4) In its September 2017 report, the U.N. 
5
Panel of Experts found that— 
6
(A) North Korea continued to violate fi-
7
nancial sanctions by using agents acting abroad 
8
on the country’s behalf; 
9
(B) foreign financial institutions provided 
10
correspondent banking services to North Ko-
11
rean persons and front companies for illicit pur-
12
poses; 
13
(C) foreign companies violated sanctions by 
14
maintaining links with North Korean financial 
15
institutions; and 
16
(D) North Korea generated at least $270 
17
million during the reporting period through the 
18
violation of sectoral sanctions. 
19
(5) North Korean entities engage in significant 
20
financial transactions through foreign bank accounts 
21
that are maintained by non-North Korean nationals, 
22
thereby masking account users’ identity in order to 
23
access financial services.

•HR 4084 IH
(6) North Korea’s sixth nuclear test on Sep-
1
tember 3, 2017, demonstrated an estimated explo-
2
sive power more than 100 times greater than that 
3
generated by its first nuclear test in 2006. 
4
(7) On February 23, 2018, the Department of 
5
the Treasury announced its largest-ever set of North 
6
Korea-related sanctions, with a particular focus on 
7
shipping and trading companies, and issued a mari-
8
time advisory to highlight North Korea’s sanctions 
9
evasion tactics. On May 9, 2019, the United States 
10
seized a North Korean ship, the Wise Honest, which 
11
had previously been detained by Indonesia for car-
12
rying coal in violation of United Nations sanctions. 
13
(8) According to the March 2019 Final Report 
14
of the U.N. Panel of Experts, ‘‘The nuclear and bal-
15
listic missile programmes of the Democratic People’s 
16
Republic of Korea remain intact and the country 
17
continues to defy Security Council resolutions 
18
through a massive increase in illegal ship-to-ship 
19
transfers of petroleum products and coal. These vio-
20
lations render the latest United Nations sanctions 
21
ineffective by flouting the caps on the import of pe-
22
troleum products and crude oil by the Democratic 
23
People’s Republic of Korea as well as the coal ban, 
24
imposed in 2017 by the Security Council in response 
25
22:14 Aug 14, 2019
H4084
5 
•HR 4084 IH
to the country’s unprecedented nuclear and ballistic 
1
missile testing.’’. 
2
(9) The U.N. Panel of Experts further con-
3
cluded: ‘‘Financial sanctions remain some of the 
4
most poorly implemented and actively evaded meas-
5
ures of the sanctions regime. Individuals empowered 
6
to act as extensions of financial institutions of the 
7
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea operate in at 
8
least five countries with seeming impunity.’’. 
9
(10) North Korea has successfully tested short- 
10
range, submarine-launched, and intercontinental bal-
11
listic missiles, and is rapidly progressing in its devel-
12
opment of a nuclear-armed missile that is capable of 
13
reaching United States territory.
