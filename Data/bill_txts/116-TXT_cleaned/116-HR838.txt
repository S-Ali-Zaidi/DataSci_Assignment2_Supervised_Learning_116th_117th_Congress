RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Kleen Energy 
Systems natural gas explosion. 
Whereas, on February 7, 2010, six workers died and dozens 
were injured in an explosion at the Kleen Energy Sys-
tems power station construction site in Middletown, Con-
necticut, when natural gas that had pooled on the ground 
caught fire; 
Whereas Peter C. Chepulis, Ronald J. Crabb, Raymond E. 
Dobratz, Kenneth W. Haskell, Jr., Roy D. Rushton, and 
Vance C. Walters tragically lost their lives as a result of 
this preventable catastrophe; 
Whereas the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
found ‘‘willful’’ violations of safety protocol that led to 
the explosion;

Whereas fines assessed as a result of these violations were 
miniscule compared to the lives lost and the public re-
sources required to rescue the injured, investigate the 
causes, and clean up the damage; 
Whereas the statutory fines under the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act of 1970 are woefully out of date due to 
Congress’ failure to modernize the law since its passage; 
Whereas each day an average of 14 workers are killed due 
to workplace injuries in the United States; and 
Whereas tens of thousands of Americans with workplace inju-
ries and illness have become permanently disabled: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors the memories of the workers killed 
2
in the Kleen Energy Systems natural gas explosion 
3
on February 7, 2010;

5

(A) the risks that workers face on the job; 
9

10
(B) the need to strengthen and modernize
