RESOLUTION 
Condemning Twitter’s partisan censorship of President 
Donald J. Trump. 
Whereas the United States is founded upon the free exchange 
of ideas and the ability of all Americans to speak freely; 
Whereas there have been instances of apparent leftwing bias 
in Twitter and other California technology companies; 
Whereas there has been a demonstrated effort by Twitter to 
obstruct and interfere with President Trump’s ability to 
get his message through to the American people; 
Whereas Twitter has followed the lead of some in the biased 
news media and deemed themselves ‘‘fact checkers’’ as a 
smokescreen to lend its political tactics some false credi-
bility;

Whereas Twitter had previously agreed to provide a public 
social media platform free of censorship, but has not 
upheld its commitment; 
Whereas a Twitter staffer deactivated the Twitter account of 
the President of the United States in 2017 without a le-
gitimate reason; 
Whereas a politically motivated Twitter staffer erroneously 
claimed that tweets from the President of the United 
States on May 27, 2020, contained ‘‘misleading’’ infor-
mation; 
Whereas Twitter has improperly applied its new ‘‘civic integ-
rity policy’’, which protects the free speech of its users; 
Whereas Twitter’s new civic integrity policy standard has not 
been applied consistently across the Twitter platform; 
Whereas Twitter has continued its historic lack of trans-
parency in its implementation of the civic integrity policy; 
Whereas the leader of Facebook, another large social media 
platform, publicly noted that privately owned social media 
platforms should not act as ‘‘arbiter[s] of truth’’; 
Whereas, unimpeded by censorship, the President’s political 
challengers continue to use Twitter to promote their po-
litical platform and encourage voter participation while 
Twitter singles out the President’s account; 
Whereas the President has more than 80 million Twitter fol-
lowers; and 
Whereas the President uses his Twitter account to commu-
nicate with the American public and bypass the often bi-
ased and discriminating reporting of the many in the 
news media: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
