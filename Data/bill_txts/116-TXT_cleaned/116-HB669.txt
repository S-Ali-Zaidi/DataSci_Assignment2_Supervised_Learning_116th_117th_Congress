SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Constitution gives Congress the sole 
3
power to declare war. 
4
(2) The framers of the Constitution understood 
5
that the monumental decision to go to war, which 
6
can result in massive death and the destruction of 
7
civilized society, must be made by the representa-
8
tives of the people and not by a single person. 
9
(3) As stated by section 2(c) of the War Powers 
10
Resolution (Public Law 93–148; 50 U.S.C. 1541), 
11
‘‘the constitutional powers of the President as Com-
12
mander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed 
13
Forces into hostilities, or into situations where im-
14
minent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated 
15
by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to 
16
(1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory au-
17
thorization, or (3) a national emergency created by 
18
attack upon the United States, its territories or pos-
19
sessions, or its armed forces’’. 
20
(4) Nuclear weapons are uniquely powerful 
21
weapons that have the capability to instantly kill 
22
millions of people, create long-term health and envi-
23
ronmental consequences throughout the world, di-
24
rectly undermine global peace, and put the United

States at existential risk from retaliatory nuclear 
1
strikes. 
2
(5) By any definition of war, a first-use nuclear 
3
strike from the United States would constitute a 
4
major act of war. 
5
(6) A first-use nuclear strike conducted absent 
6
a declaration of war by Congress would violate the 
7
Constitution. 
8
(b) DECLARATION OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
9
United States that no first-use nuclear strike should be 
10
conducted absent a declaration of war by Congress.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON CONDUCT OF FIRST-USE NU-
12
CLEAR STRIKES. 
13
(a) PROHIBITION.—Notwithstanding any other provi-
14
sion of law, the President may not use the Armed Forces 
15
of the United States to conduct a first-use nuclear strike 
16
unless such strike is conducted pursuant to a declaration 
17
of war by Congress that expressly authorizes such strike. 
18
(b) FIRST-USE NUCLEAR STRIKE DEFINED.—In this 
19
section, the term ‘‘first-use nuclear strike’’ means an at-
20
tack using nuclear weapons against an enemy that is con-
21
ducted without the President determining that the enemy 
22
has first launched a nuclear strike against the United 
23
States or an ally of the United States.
