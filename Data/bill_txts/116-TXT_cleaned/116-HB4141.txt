health care that is unavailable to the individual in 
13
the individual’s community; 
14
(2) each State and unit of local government 
15
should establish programs that offer community- 
16
based health services (including mental health and 
17
substance use disorder services) commensurate with 
18
the principle stated in paragraph (1); and 
19
(3) Federal reimbursement for expenditures on 
20
medical assistance made available through the 
21
amendments made by this Act should not supplant 
22
an investment in community-based services.
