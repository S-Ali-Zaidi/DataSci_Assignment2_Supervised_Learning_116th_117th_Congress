actment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Rail-
1
road Administration shall carry out the following: 
2
(1) Complete a study on how signage can be 
3
used to improve safety in the rail industry that in-
4
cludes— 
5
(A) a review of how signs used for other 
6
modes of transportation may be effectively used 
7
in the rail industry; 
8
(B) a review of how signs used in the rail-
9
road industry differ; and 
10
(C) an analysis of whether a uniform sys-
11
tem for speed signs across the entire railroad 
12
industry would benefit the railroad industry and 
13
improve safety. 
14
(2) Reevaluate existing seat securement mecha-
15
nisms and their susceptibility to inadvertent rota-
16
tion, to identify a means to prevent the failure of 
17
these devices to maintain seat securement. 
18
(3) Conduct research to evaluate the causes of 
19
passenger injuries in passenger railcar derailments 
20
and evaluate potential methods for mitigating such 
21
injuries.

(b) REQUIREMENTS FOR AMTRAK.—Not later than 
5
18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, Amtrak

stand 
all 
locomotive 
operating 
characteristics, 
20
alarms, and the appropriate response to abnormal 
21
conditions; 
22
(3) require that all engineers undergo simulator 
23
training before operating new or unfamiliar equip-

a new territory and experience normal and abnormal 
3
conditions on that territory; 
4

5
developing training and qualification programs to 
6
identify the most effective strategies for preparing 
7
crewmembers to safely operate new equipment on 
8
new territories; 
9
(5) complete a comprehensive assessment of the 
10
territories to ensure that necessary wayside signs 
11
and plaques are identified, highly noticeable, and 
12
strategically located to provide operating crews the 
13
information needed to safely operate their trains; 
14
(6) conduct training that specifies and rein-
15
forces how each crewmember, including those who 
16
have not received their certifications or qualifica-
17
tions, may be used as a resource to assist in estab-
18
lishing and maintaining safe train operations; 
19

20
that all operating documents are up to date and ac-
21
curate before initiating new or revised revenue oper-
22
ations; 
23
(8) incorporate all prerevenue service planning, 
24
construction, and route verification work into the
