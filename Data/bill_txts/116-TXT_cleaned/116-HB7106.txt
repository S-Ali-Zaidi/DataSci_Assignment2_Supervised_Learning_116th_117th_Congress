tional Priorities asserts ‘‘Having a fundamental un-
1
derstanding of how people and societies behave, why 
2
they respond the way they do, what they find impor-
3
tant, what they believe or value, and what and how 
4
they think about others is critical for the country’s 
5
well-being in today’s global environment.’’. 
6
(2) There is a national need for investing in di-
7
verse basic research social science, and facilitating 
8
transition of those findings to inform national de-
9
fense priorities and actions. 
10
(3) In 2008, while giving a speech entitled ‘‘Na-
11
tional Security: What New Expertise is Needed?’’, 
12
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated ‘‘Too 
13
many mistakes have been made over the years be-
14
cause our government and military did not under-
15
stand—or even seek to understand—the countries or 
16
cultures we were dealing with.’’. 
17
(4) In response, the Department of Defense ini-
18
tiated a basic social science research program to im-
19
prove basic understanding of the social, cultural, be-
20
havioral, and political forces that shape regions of 
21
the world of strategic importance to the United 
22
States.

defense-wide basic social sciences program that ‘‘de-
1
spite facing challenges with establishing a stable, 
2
well-functioning organizational structure as well as 
3
resource limitations, the program has made impor-
4
tant contributions’’ and that the program has suc-
5
cessfully strengthened ties between the Department 
6
and the social science community.

(6) Maintaining a basic social sciences research 
8
program provides the Department of Defense critical 
9
access to expertise to inform cultural understanding, 
10
support technological edge, counter adversarial social 
11
interventions, and understand drivers to strengthen 
12
alliances and attract new partners. 
13
(7) Continued investment in basic social science 
14
research is particularly crucial at a time when peer 
15
and near-peer adversaries are increasingly employing 
16
elements of malign influence, disinformation, and 
17
predatory economics in concert with technological 
18
capabilities.
