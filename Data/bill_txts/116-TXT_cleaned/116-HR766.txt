faithfully to execute the office of the President of the 
United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution of the United 
States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take 
care that the laws be faithfully executed—Donald J. 
Trump, acting both directly and through his agents with-
in and outside the United States Government, abused the 
powers of the Presidency for his own personal political 
gain; 
Whereas President Trump, using the powers of his high of-
fice, solicited the interference of Ukraine in the 2020 
United States Presidential election;
