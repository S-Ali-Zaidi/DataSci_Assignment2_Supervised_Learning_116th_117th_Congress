sessment of the national transportation system re-
2
cently published by the Department of Transpor-
3

(C) freight volume will increase by more 
12
than 40 percent by 2045; 
13
(D) Americans are currently stuck in traf-
14
fic for more than 42 hours each year, on aver-
15
age; 
16
(E) the current annual cost of congestion 
17
in

amounts 
to 
18
$160,000,000,000;

11
created the Smart City Challenge to assist cities in 
12
addressing the challenges facing our Nation’s trans-
13
portation system through innovative and creative 
14
means, utilizing both the public and the private sec-
15

pressing problems, the Smart City Challenge aimed 
19
to spark and spread innovation through a mixture of 
20
collaboration, competition, and experimentation.
