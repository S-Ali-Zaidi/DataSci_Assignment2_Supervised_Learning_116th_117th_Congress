A BILL 
To amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act 
to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
to establish a grant program for purposes of facilitating 
State efforts to establish or maintain all-payer claims 
databases, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Transparency and Accountability in Health Care Costs 
5
and Prices Act of 2020’’.

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
1
(1) According to official estimates published by 
2
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 
3
Americans spent a total of $3.6 trillion on health 
4
care in 2018, or $11,172 per person. 
5
(2) Spending on hospital care services reached 
6
$1.2 trillion in 2018 and rose by 4.5 percent from 
7
the previous year. This growth occurred even as 
8
Americans made fewer hospital visits because of 
9
growth in hospital prices. 
10
(3) Spending on physician visits and clinical 
11
services reached $725.6 billion in 2018 and rose by 
12
4.1 percent from the previous year. 
13
(4) Spending on prescription drugs reached 
14
$335 billion in 2018 and rose by 2.5 percent from 
15
the previous year. 
16
(5) According to a 2019 analysis of a subset of 
17
commercial insurance claims by the independent, 
18
non-partisan Health Care Cost Institute, prices for 
19
common medical services could vary up to 25 times 
20
between different metro areas and up to 39 times 
21
for the same service within the same metro area. 
22
(6) A 2015 analysis of a subset of commercial 
23
insurance claims by Yale, University of Pennsyl-
24
vania, Carnegie Mellon, and MIT researchers found 
25
00:45 Mar 03, 2020
H6004

•HR 6004 IH
that even within one hospital, prices for certain com-
1
mon services like lower limb MRIs, knee replace-
2
ments, and colonoscopies could vary by 23.5 percent 
3
on average depending on which insurer covered the 
4
patient. 
5
(7) Information about contracts between pro-
6
viders and insurers available to researchers, policy-
7
makers, and the public is limited or incomplete be-
8
cause these contracts frequently prohibit disclosure 
9
of information about how providers are paid. 
10
(8) All-payer claims databases (APCDs) are 
11
large-scale databases increasingly adopted by States 
12
to collect health care claims data across different 
13
payers such as private insurers, government em-
14
ployee health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. 
15
(9) APCD data can be shared with vetted and 
16
authorized users to make it easier to track trends in 
17
health care prices, create tools for consumers to 
18
check price and quality, assist employers and health 
19
plans in making more informed decisions when de-
20
veloping employer-sponsored health plans, test new 
21
ideas for holding down health care costs, and guide 
22
policymakers in developing health care policy. 
23
(10) In 2019, the independent, non-partisan 
24
RAND Corporation published the first broad-based

study reporting prices paid by private health plans 
1
to hospitals identified by name. This important 
2
study tracked important disparities in price trends 
3
across the nation, with relative prices increasing rap-
4
idly from 2015 to 2017 for hospitals in some States, 
5
while falling in others. This work was made possible 
6
in part through the use of data from APCDs in New 
7
Hampshire and Colorado. 
8
(11) Since 2015, Oregon has used data from its 
9
APCD to review insurers’ proposed premium rates, 
10
including determining whether or not proposed pre-
11
miums are excessive. Oregon has also used its 
12
APCD to create an annual report on hospital reim-
13
bursement variations from different insurers. 
14
(12) Minnesota and Virginia have used data 
15
from their APCDs to shine a spotlight on spending 
16
for low-value—possibly even unnecessary—medical 
17
services. 
18
(13) Washington State has used data from its 
19
APCD 
to 
create 
the 
Washington 
20
HealthCareCompare tool that helps patients learn 
21
about local prices for medical services at local doc-
22
tors’ offices, hospitals, and outpatient centers, and 
23
puts those prices in context by highlighting what 
24
kinds of prices can be considered typical, low, or 
25

high. Additional States that have developed price 
1
transparency tools from their APCDs include New 
2
Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Colorado, Mary-
3
land, and Rhode Island. 
4
(14) According to the APCD Council, a learn-
5
ing collaborative of public and private organizations 
6
working on developing and establishing APCDs, at 
7
least 18 States have enacted State laws establishing 
8
APCDs. 
9
(15) While many States have or are considering 
10
establishing APCDs, current APCDs vary in the 
11
types of data collected, the types of users allowed to 
12
access the data, the types of data that can be pub-
13
lished, and how much authorized users are charged 
14
to access the data. 
15
(16) A 2016 Supreme Court decision, Gobeille 
16
v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., prohibited States 
17
from requiring claim submissions to APCDs from 
18
large employers that pay for health benefits directly 
19
instead of purchasing health coverage from insur-
20
ance companies. This limited the data that States 
21
could mandate for inclusion in an APCD. 
22
(17) Supporting the establishment of APCDs is 
23
an important way to promote transparency and un-
24
derstanding of overall health care spending. 
25

•HR 6004 IH
(18) State APCDs should be encouraged to col-
1
lect data from more types of payers; make it easier 
2
and more affordable for APCD data to be used to 
3
assist patients and providers in making informed 
4
choices about care; make it easier and more afford-
5
able for APCD data to be used for efforts to bring 
6
health care cost growth under control and improve 
7
insurance coverage; and permit their data to be used 
8
to report provider-level prices.
