(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
5
Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111–203) 
6
(‘‘Dodd-Frank’’), was signed into law on July 21, 
7
2010, in order to, among other things, advance the 
8
goals of protecting consumers from predatory finan-
9
cial services practices and products that led to the 
10
2007–2009 financial crisis. 
11
(2) Title X of Dodd-Frank established a new 
12
Federal independent watchdog, known as the Con-
13
sumer Financial Protection Bureau (‘‘Consumer Bu-
14
reau’’), with broad authority to ensure that all hard-
15
working consumers are given clear, accurate infor-
16
mation that they need to shop for mortgages, credit 
17
cards, and other consumer financial products or 
18
services and to protect consumers from hidden fees, 
19
abusive terms, and other unfair, deceptive, or abu-

sive acts or practices through strong implementation 
1
and enforcement of Federal consumer financial laws. 
2
(3) Before the Consumer Bureau was estab-
3
lished, Federal financial regulators were tasked with 
4
the dual responsibilities of supervising institutions 
5
for safety and soundness and compliance with con-
6
sumer protections under Federal consumer financial 
7
laws. These agencies often prioritized the profit-
8
ability of their regulated entities over the protection 
9
of consumers, even when institutions were found to 
10
have engaged in practices detrimental to their own 
11
customers’ financial well-being. 
12
(4) Congress purposefully created the inde-
13
pendent Consumer Bureau within the Federal Re-
14
serve System to address past regulatory gaps in our 
15
country’s financial regulatory regime—gaps that re-
16
sulted in the most severe global financial crisis since 
17
the Great Depression. Among other things, Federal 
18
financial regulators were too reluctant to exercise 
19
their rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement au-
20
thorities to protect consumers from the misdeeds of 
21
the Consumer Bureau’s regulated entities. In cre-
22
ating the Consumer Bureau, Congress explicitly laid 
23
out in statute the Consumer Bureau’s purpose, five 
24
objectives, and six primary functions. Specifically: 
25
01:31 Mar 19, 2019

•HR 1500 IH
(A) Section 1021(a) of Dodd-Frank states 
1
that the Consumer Bureau, ‘‘shall seek to im-
2
plement and, where applicable, enforce Federal 
3
consumer financial law consistently for the pur-
4
pose of ensuring that all consumers have access 
5
to markets for consumer financial products and 
6
services and that markets for consumer finan-
7
cial products and services are fair, transparent, 
8
and competitive’’. 
9
(B) Section 1021(b) of Dodd-Frank au-
10
thorizes the Consumer Bureau, ‘‘to exercise its 
11
authorities under Federal consumer financial 
12
law for the purposes of ensuring that, with re-
13
spect to consumer financial products and serv-
14
ices—(1) consumers are provided with timely 
15
and understandable information to make re-
16
sponsible decisions about financial transactions; 
17
(2) consumers are protected from unfair, decep-
18
tive, or abusive acts and practices and from dis-
19
crimination; (3) outdated, unnecessary, or un-
20
duly burdensome regulations are regularly iden-
21
tified and addressed in order to reduce unwar-
22
ranted regulatory burdens; (4) Federal con-
23
sumer financial law is enforced consistently, 
24
without regard to the status of a person as a

depository institution, in order to promote fair 
1
competition; and (5) markets for consumer fi-
2
nancial products and services operate trans-
3
parently and efficiently to facilitate access and 
4
innovation.’’. 
5
(C) Section 1021(c) of Dodd-Frank estab-
6
lishes the primary functions of the Consumer 
7
Bureau to be, ‘‘(1) conducting financial edu-
8
cation programs; (2) collecting, investigating, 
9
and responding to consumer complaints; (3) col-
10
lecting, researching, monitoring, and publishing 
11
information relevant to the functioning of mar-
12
kets for consumer financial products and serv-
13
ices to identify risks to consumers and the 
14
proper functioning of such markets; (4) subject 
15
to sections 1024 through 1026, supervising cov-
16
ered persons for compliance with Federal con-
17
sumer financial law, and taking appropriate en-
18
forcement action to address violations of Fed-
19
eral consumer financial law; (5) issuing rules, 
20
orders, and guidance implementing Federal con-
21
sumer financial law; and (6) performing such 
22
support activities as may be necessary or useful 
23
to facilitate the other functions of the Bu-
24
reau.’’. 
25

•HR 1500 IH
(5) In doing so, Congress explicitly laid out 
1
these consumer-focused purpose, objectives, and pri-
2
mary functions for the Consumer Bureau to ensure 
3
that all consumers and all communities are pro-
4
tected. This is of extreme importance to commu-
5
nities of color who have been disproportionately im-
6
pacted by the inequities of the financial system, re-
7
sulting in an extreme racial wealth divide. Decades 
8
of segregation and discrimination have prevented 
9
consumers of colors from amassing wealth equal to 
10
their white counterparts, while predatory financial 
11
practices of have stripped consumers of color of their 
12
nominal existing wealth. For example, over the past 
13
30 years, the average wealth of White families has 
14
grown by 84 percent—1.2 times the rate of growth 
15
for the Latino population and three times the rate 
16
of growth for the Black population. In light of his-
17
torical practices and current-day disparities in bank-
18
ing and lending practices, the Consumer Bureau 
19
plays a key role in protecting communities of color 
20
from wealth-stripping financial products and ensur-
21
ing their right to wealth building opportunities. The 
22
agency’s enforcement actions in auto lending, mort-
23
gages, and credit cards, and its rulemaking efforts 
24
have sought to address the predatory financial prod-
25
01:31 Mar 19, 2019

•HR 1500 IH
ucts such as payday loans and prepaid cards that 
1
are prolific in communities of color. The Consumer 
2
Bureau is essential in protecting vulnerable commu-
3
nities from discriminatory financial practices that 
4
has both perpetuated and exacerbated the racial 
5
wealth gap. 
6
(6) Under Dodd-Frank, the Deputy Director of 
7
the Consumer Bureau shall serve as the Acting Di-
8
rector in the absence or unavailability of the Direc-
9
tor, until the President appoints and the Senate con-
10
firms a new Director. Despite the plain letter of the 
11
law establishing a succession order to fill a vacancy 
12
in the Director’s position and the clear legislative 
13
history underscoring the importance of having an 
14
independent Federal consumer-focused agency, when 
15
the Consumer Bureau Director Richard Cordray re-
16
signed in November 2017, President Trump refused 
17
to recognize the Deputy Director as the rightful 
18
head of the agency and instead installed Mr. Mick 
19
Mulvaney, the Director of the White House Office of 
20
Management and Budget, to serve as the Consumer 
21
Bureau’s Acting Director. This appointment of a 
22
White House cabinet official to run the Consumer 
23
Bureau raises profound conflict of interest questions 
24
01:31 Mar 19, 2019
H1500
8 
•HR 1500 IH
and undermines the vital independent nature of the 
1
agency. 
2
(7) Additionally, the position of Acting Director 
3
is, by its nature, intended to be a temporary assign-
4
ment to maintain the status quo at an agency and 
5
to ensure the agency is fulfilling its statutory pur-
6
pose and mandates, until the President appoints, 
7
and the Senate confirms a permanent Director. Nev-
8
ertheless, during his tenure, Mr. Mulvaney instituted 
9
drastic and severe changes to the Consumer Bu-
10
reau’s daily operations and priorities contrary to the 
11
agency’s statutory purpose and mandates. 
12
(8) The daily operations of a Federal agency 
13
are guided by its official mission contained in its 
14
long-term strategic plan. The Consumer Bureau’s 
15
mission should embrace both the spirit and plain let-
16
ter of the law by fully recognizing the agency’s stat-
17
utory purpose, objectives, and functions. It is trou-
18
bling that the Consumer Bureau, under Mr. 
19
Mulvaney, issued a Strategic Plan for Fiscal Year 
20
(‘‘FY’’) 2018–FY 2022 that appears to deemphasize 
21
the Consumer Bureau’s core mandate under section 
22
1021(a) of Dodd-Frank to, ‘‘enforce Federal con-
23
sumer financial law consistently for the purpose of 
24
ensuring that all consumers have access to markets 
25
01:31 Mar 19, 2019

•HR 1500 IH
for consumer financial products and services’’, by 
1
not referencing the importance of enforcement in its 
2
mission. Instead, it emphasizes financial education 
3
by stating that the agency’s new mission is, ‘‘[t]o 
4
regulate the offering and provision of consumer fi-
5
nancial products or services under the Federal con-
6
sumer financial laws and to educate and empower 
7
consumers to make better informed financial deci-
8
sions’’. This is in stark contrast from the Consumer 
9
Bureau’s Strategic Plan for FY 2013–FY 2017, 
10
which stated that the agency’s mission is helping, 
11
‘‘consumer finance markets work by making rules 
12
more effective, by consistently and fairly enforcing 
13
those rules, and by empowering consumers to take 
14
more control over their economic lives’’ (emphasis 
15
added). 
16
(9) Mr. Mulvaney has been praised by the 
17
White House for his efforts to undermine the Con-
18
sumer Bureau, with one anonymous advisor ac-
19
knowledging in a July 24, 2018, Politico article that, 
20
‘‘His mission was to blow that up, which he has. He 
21
is very well-suited to the chaos.’’. Mr. Mulvaney’s 
22
misguided actions have included, among other 
23
things—

forcement, and allowing them to ignore the law; 
1
and 
2
(M) neglecting to impose promptly any 
3
civil money penalty on a bank when it was 
4
found to be, among other things, improperly ob-
5
taining consumer reports and furnishing to con-

sumer reporting agencies inaccurate informa-
7
tion about consumers’ credit. 
8
(10) The repeated efforts under Mr. Mulvaney’s 
9
leadership to hamstring the good work, passion, 
10
commitment, and the capacity of dedicated profes-
11
sional, career Consumer Bureau staff to fulfill the 
12
agency’s statutory mission has likely contributed to 
13
low employee morale. According to a government- 
14
wide annual survey published in December 2018 
15
that was conducted by the nonprofit, nonpartisan 
16
Partnership for Public Service, the Consumer Bu-
17
reau experienced the largest decline in employee mo-
18
rale for a government agency of its size. A workplace 
19
with low morale undermines, among other things, 
20
the agency’s ability to hold bad actors accountable 
21
when they harm consumers, and if unaddressed, will 
22
distort the functioning of fair and competitive con-
23
sumer marketplaces. 
24
21:19 Mar 20, 2019
H1500
14 
•HR 1500 IH
(11) Despite the fact that the agency has been 
1
referred to as the Consumer Financial Protection 
2
Bureau since it was created in 2010, Mr. Mulvaney 
3
opted to change the agency’s well-known name. Al-
4
though this decision is supposedly intended to ensure 
5
that the agency is in compliance with Dodd-Frank, 
6
when this change is viewed in conjunction with the 
7
other detrimental actions to undermine the effective-
8
ness of the agency, it can only be interpreted as an 
9
attempt to reduce the public’s awareness of, and sig-
10
nificant support for, the agency’s role as the top 
11
Federal consumer cop as well as to obscure the 
12
public’s ability to easily identify the appropriate 
13
Federal agency to contact when faced with predatory 
14
behavior by financial actors. As such, while some 
15
may view this particular decision as minor, the ac-
16
tion served as an important symbolic and literal ma-
17
neuver by the Trump Administration, through its 
18
appointment of Mr. Mulvaney, to diminish and un-
19
dermine the consumer-focused mission of the Con-
20
sumer Bureau. Director Kathy Kraninger, who was 
21
duly nominated by the President and confirmed by 
22
the Senate, announced plans in an email to staff on 
23
December 19, 2018, to reverse course and return to 
24
utilizing the agency’s well-known name. However, 
25
01:31 Mar 19, 2019
H1500
15 
•HR 1500 IH
questions remain regarding how this change will be 
1
implemented and to what extent the agency may 
2
continue to utilize Mr. Mulvaney’s preferred name in 
3
certain circumstances. 
4
(12) During Mr. Mulvaney’s more than 12- 
5
month tenure running the agency, he only appeared 
6
once before the House Financial Services Committee 
7
to discuss his activities at the Consumer Bureau. 
8
This is despite the fact that the law requires, at a 
9
minimum, the Director’s testimony before the Com-
10
mittee semi-annually. This weak congressional over-
11
sight under the direction of the previous Republican 
12
Majority pales in comparison to their oversight of 
13
the Consumer Bureau during former Director Rich-
14
ard Cordray’s tenure. During Director Cordray’s 
15
tenure, he and other senior Consumer Bureau offi-
16
cials testified before Congress more than 60 times; 
17
the agency was compelled to produce more than 
18
200,000 pages of documents in response to over 90 
19
letters of inquiry; more than 20 subpoenas were sent 
20
to the Consumer Bureau; and several of the Con-
21
sumer Bureau’s former and current employees were 
22
compelled to sit for depositions over 21 days, that 
23
lasted 136 hours, and produced 3,194 pages of tran-
24
scripts. 
25
01:31 Mar 19, 2019
H1500
16 
•HR 1500 IH
(13) Dodd-Frank gives the Director of the Con-
1
sumer Bureau broad administrative and executive 
2
powers to, among other things: fix the number of, 
3
and appoint and direct, all employees of the agency; 
4
direct the establishment and maintenance of divi-
5
sions or other offices within the agency; determine 
6
the character of, and the necessity for, the obliga-
7
tions and expenditure of funds; and the use and ex-
8
penditure of funds. These powers, however, are re-
9
quired to be exercised in a manner consistent with 
10
carrying out the responsibilities under Title X of 
11
Dodd-Frank, which includes complying with the enu-
12
merated Federal consumer financial laws under the 
13
Title, and satisfying the obligations in other applica-
14
ble laws. Mr. Mulvaney’s destructive actions have 
15
demonstrated the need for legislation to reorient the 
16
Director’s discretionary authority to ensure the 
17
maintenance of all statutorily mandated policies, 
18
functions, and offices of the Consumer Bureau re-
19
gardless of who is leading the agency. 
20
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—The following is the sense 
21
of Congress: 
22
(1) The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
23
should meet its statutory purpose in a transparent 
24
and accountable manner by operating in a way that 
25
01:31 Mar 19, 2019
H1500
17 
•HR 1500 IH
is consistent with both the spirit and plain letter of 
1
the law. This includes the agency fully carrying out 
2
the agency’s statutory purpose, objectives, and func-
3
tions, and the agency being transparent, timely, and 
4
responsive to all requests from Congress. 
5
(2) Dodd-Frank underscores that the agency is 
6
designed to serve as an independent Federal agency 
7
that is primarily focused on the protection of all con-
8
sumers, without any undue influence of partisan 
9
whims and special industry interests, in carrying out 
10
its responsibilities and duties. 
11
(3) The official name of the agency should be 
12
consistent with this mandate, and the agency should, 
13
figuratively and literally, put ‘‘Consumers’’ first by 
14
using its better-known name as the ‘‘Consumer Fi-
15
nancial Protection Bureau’’. Thus, any remaining 
16
utilization by the agency of the name, ‘‘Bureau of 
17
Consumer Financial Protection’’, or the acronym 
18
‘‘BCFP’’, should cease in all forms. 
19
(4) The statute establishing the Consumer Bu-
20
reau has been grossly misinterpreted under Mr. 
21
Mulvaney’s leadership, in a manner that is incon-
22
sistent with the agency’s statutory purpose, objec-
23
tives, and functions. One example of this was Mr. 
24
Mulvaney’s inane suggestion that the statutory re-
25
01:31 Mar 19, 2019
H1500
18 
•HR 1500 IH
quirement for the Director to appear before relevant 
1
Congressional Committees to discuss its semi-annual 
2
reports could be interpreted as requiring the Direc-
3
tor merely to attend a hearing and not answer ques-
4
tions, despite the well-established interpretation of a 
5
similar statutory requirement for the Chair of the 
6
Federal Reserve Board of Governors to appear be-
7
fore the House Financial Services Committee and 
8
the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
9
Committee on a semi-annual basis about the mone-
10
tary policy report, as required by the Humphrey- 
11
Hawkins Full Employment Act. In the face of such 
12
blatant and disrespectful attempts to warp the au-
13
thorizing and oversight role of the first branch of 
14
the Federal Government—the United States Con-
15
gress—by the Trump Administration, Congress 
16
must, in this instance, now refine the Consumer Bu-
17
reau’s authority to ensure that the vital role that the 
18
Consumer Bureau should be playing within the 
19
country’s financial regulatory regime is not effec-
20
tively destroyed by the agency’s current leadership. 
21
(5) The Consumer Bureau, now under a new 
22
Director, should promptly reverse all anti-consumer 
23
actions taken during Mr. Mulvaney’s tenure, includ-
24
ing the actions identified by this legislation, to en-
25
01:31 Mar 19, 2019
H1500

•HR 1500 IH
sure that the agency is fully complying with its stat-
1
utory purpose, objectives, and functions to protect 
2
all consumers, including communities of color and 
3
vulnerable populations. One important action is for 
4
the Consumer Bureau to resume robust fair lending 
5
enforcement to ensure that every consumer has fair 
6
and equal access to affordable financial products and 
7

8
the Consumer Bureau to immediately resume super-
9
vision of its regulated entities for compliance with 
10
the Military Lending Act to ensure for the most ro-
11
bust 
and 
efficient 
protection 
of 
active-duty 
12
servicemembers and their families. Other examples 
13
include the Consumer Bureau significantly revising 
14
its strategic plan to align it with its statutory pur-
15
pose, objectives and functions, and for the agency to 
16
immediately resume coordinating closely with other 
17
Federal agencies, such as the Department of Edu-
18
cation and the Department of Defense, and State 
19
regulators, as is required by section 1015 of Dodd-

State officials, including law enforcement, as well as

have occurred at this agency since the departure of
