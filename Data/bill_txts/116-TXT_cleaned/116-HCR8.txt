Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention re-
ported that 25 States and the District of Columbia saw 
statistically significant increases in overdose deaths from 
2015 to 2016; 
Whereas American medical schools train future doctors and 
other health care providers how to appropriately treat 
acute and long-term pain, and provide additional training 
for current practitioners through continuing medical edu-
cation on the same; 
Whereas one of the goals of the American Medical Associa-
tion’s Opioid Task Force is to enhance education and 
training; 
Whereas medical schools have begun integrating content re-
quired by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education 
to address substance abuse and pain management; and 
Whereas the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
Education has approved program requirements for addic-
tion medicine, and there are 45 addiction fellowships 
across the country with a goal of having 125 by 2025: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) medical colleges should, as part of their cur-
3
riculum, continue to improve and expand training 
4
for the Nation’s future physicians about properly 
5
treating pain and prescribing opioids, so that all 
6
providers graduate with a better understanding of 
7
proper prescribing of opioids;
