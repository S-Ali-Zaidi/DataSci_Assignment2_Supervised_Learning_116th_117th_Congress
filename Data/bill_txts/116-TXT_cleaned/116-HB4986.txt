Congress finds that— 
7
(1) climate change most severely impacts vul-
8
nerable and disadvantaged communities in the

United States and around the world;

(2) it is the responsibility of the United States 
1
Government to work with its global partners to pro-
2
mote environmental justice and climate justice; 
3
(3) the report of the United Nations Environ-
4
ment Programme entitled ‘‘Climate Change and the 
5
Cost of Capital in Developing Countries’’, dated May 
6
2018, found that, in the 10 years prior to the publi-
7
cation of the report, climate vulnerability has cost 
8
the 20 nations most affected by catastrophes rooted 
9
in climate change an additional $62,000,000,000 in 
10
interest payments alone; 
11
(4) individuals and families, particularly com-
12
munities of color, indigenous communities, and low- 
13
income communities, that are on the frontlines of 
14
climate change across the globe are often in close 
15
proximity to environmental stressors or sources of 
16
pollution; 
17
(5) the communities described in paragraph 
18
(4)— 
19
(A) are often the first exposed to the 
20
causes and impacts of climate change; and 
21
(B) have the fewest resources with which 
22
to mitigate those impacts or to relocate; 
23
(6) all efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate 
24
change must include specific protections for and ac-

1
communities of color, indigenous peoples, women, 
2
and other frontline communities and marginalized 
3
peoples around the world; 
4
(7) in Paris, on December 12, 2015, the parties 
5
to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
6
Climate Change adopted the Paris Agreement, a 
7
benchmark agreement— 
8
(A) to combat climate change; and 
9
(B) to accelerate and intensify the actions 
10
and investments needed for a sustainable low 
11
carbon future; 
12
(8) the Paris Agreement, to which the United 
13
States is a party, acknowledges, ‘‘Parties should, 
14
when taking action to address climate change, re-
15
spect, promote and consider their respective obliga-
16

18

19

(B) recognizes ‘‘the need for an effective 
4
and progressive response to the urgent threat of 
5
climate change’’; 
6
(10) it is imperative for all countries to under-
7
take mitigation activities to rapidly meet the goal of 
8
limiting global warming to not more than 1.5 de-

grees Celsius; 
10
(11) developed countries have the greatest ca-
11
pacity to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions, 
12
while— 
13
(A) developing countries have the least ca-
14
pacity to engage in mitigation activities; and 
15
(B) the capacity of developing countries to 
16
engage in mitigation activities is less than the 
17
national mitigation potential of those developing 
18
countries; 
19
(12) the determination for the fair share of 
20
mitigation and adaptation activities for each country 
21
must take into account— 
22
(A) the historic greenhouse gas emissions 
23
of each country; and

(B) the current capacity of each country to

(13) developed countries that have historically 
4
emitted a disproportionately high share of green-
5
house gas emissions, and reaped the economic bene-
6
fits of those polluting activities, have a cor-
7
responding disproportionately greater responsibility

to engage in global mitigation and adaptation activi-

that have historically polluted far less; 
11
(14) the only realistic way for less industri-
12
alized countries to meet their full mitigation poten-
13
tial is through international climate financing by

(15) in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, developed 
16
countries committed to jointly mobilize, starting in 
17
2020, $100,000,000,000 per year in public climate 
18
financing (as well as private investment and other 
19
alternative forms of finance), for developing coun-
20
tries, a commitment reaffirmed in 2015 in Decision

(16) the $100,000,000,000 commitment de-
1
scribed in paragraph (15) was a political com-

promise that falls short of the actual financing needs

(17) Bloomberg New Energy Finance has esti-

mated that the transition to renewable energy

(19) the Green Climate Fund was created in

2010 by 194 countries to serve as a crucial financ-

financing— 
10
(1) as an essential part of the global effort to 
11
combat climate change; and

14
justice and climate justice;

(B) supports programs and projects devel-
16
oped by recipient countries and communities;

18
free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous 
19
peoples and other impacted communities; 
20
(D) promotes gender equality as essential 
21
in all of the projects and programs supported 
22
by climate financing; 
23
(E) includes best practices for environ-
24
mental and social safeguards to ensure that

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
6
(a) IN GENERAL.—There are authorized to be appro-
7
priated for fiscal year 2020 and each fiscal year thereafter 
8
such sums as may be necessary for contributions to the 
9
Green Climate Fund— 
10
(1) to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions re-
11
ductions required to keep the planet at or below 1.5 
12
degrees Celsius of global warming, consistent with 
13
the goals of the Paris Agreement; and 
14
(2) to exceed the commitment by developed 
15
countries to jointly mobilize, starting in 2020, 
16
$100,000,000,000 for climate financing each year, 
17
as committed to in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord 
18
and reaffirmed in 2015 in Decision 1/CP.21 of the 
19
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
20
Change, Adoption of the Paris Agreement.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
22
gress that climate financing needs are significantly greater 
23
than those described in subsection (a)(2).
