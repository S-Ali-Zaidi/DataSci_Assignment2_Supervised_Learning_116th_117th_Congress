RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the month of 
September as ‘‘National Voting Rights Month’’. 
Whereas voting is one of the single most important rights 
that can be exercised in our democracy; 
Whereas over the course of history, various voter suppression 
laws in the United States have hindered, and even pro-
hibited, certain individuals and groups from exercising 
this right; 
Whereas during the 19th and early 20th centuries, many Na-
tive Americans and Americans who were born abroad, 
many individuals who did not speak or write English, and

many who were formerly subjected to slavery, were de-
nied full citizenship and prevented from voting by 
English literacy tests; 
Whereas since the 1870s, minority groups such as African 
Americans in the South suffered from the oppressive ef-
fects of Jim Crow laws designed to prevent political, eco-
nomic, and social mobility; 
Whereas African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Na-
tive Americans, and other underrepresented groups were 
subject to violence, poll taxes, literacy tests, all-White pri-
maries, property ownership tests, and grandfather clauses 
that sought to suppress their right to vote; 
Whereas members of the aforementioned groups and others 
are currently, in some cases, subject to intimidation, 
voter roll purges, bans on former prisoners from voting, 
and financial barriers that act effectively as modern day 
poll taxes; 
Whereas in 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 to protect the rights of African Americans and 
other traditionally disenfranchised groups to vote, among 
other reasons; 
Whereas in 2013, in the landmark Shelby County v. Holder 
case, the Supreme Court invalidated section 4 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965, dismantling the preclearance pro-
vision in the law that protected voters in States and units 
of local governments that historically have suppressed the 
rights of minorities to vote; 
Whereas since the preclearance provisions of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 have been vacated, among other ef-
fects, many States’ gerrymandered districts have gone

unchallenged or have become less likely to be invalidated 
by the courts; 
Whereas these gerrymandered districts have been found to 
have a discriminatory impact on traditionally disenfran-
chised minorities through tactics that include ‘‘cracking’’, 
diluting their voting power across many districts, and 
‘‘packing’’, concentrating minority voters’ power in one 
district to reduce their voting power in other districts; 
Whereas the courts have found the congressional and, in 
some cases, State legislative district maps in Texas, 
North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, 
Wisconsin, and other States to be gerrymandered dis-
tricts that were created to favor some groups over others; 
Whereas the Shelby County v. Holder Supreme Court deci-
sion calls on Congress to update the formula in the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 to better match current data; 
Whereas in at least 23 States, some form of restrictive voting 
law has been instituted since 2013; 
Whereas these restrictive voting laws encompass cutbacks in 
early voting, voter roll purges, placement of faulty equip-
ment in minority communities, requirement of photo 
identification, and elimination of same-day registration; 
Whereas these policies could outright disenfranchise or make 
voting much more difficult for more than 80 million mi-
nority, elderly, poor, and disabled voters, among other 
groups; 
Whereas in 2016 alone, discriminatory laws in North Caro-
lina, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Texas were ruled to 
violate voters’ rights and were overturned by the courts;

Whereas the COVID–19 public health emergency has only ex-
acerbated the state of elections and voters’ access to the 
ballot; 
Whereas the lack of fair and safe election policies threaten 
minority communities, which have been disproportionately 
impacted and disenfranchised due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, and their access to the ballot; 
Whereas tackling the challenges of administrating upcoming 
elections requires increasing the accessibility of vote-by- 
mail and other limited contact options to ensure the pro-
tection of voters’ health and safety amid a global pan-
demic; 
Whereas as voting by mail becomes a safer and a more acces-
sible option for voters to exercise their Constitutional 
right to vote during these unprecedented times, a fully 
functional and reliable United States Postal Service is of 
paramount importance in successfully conducting elec-
tions; 
Whereas Congress must work to combat any attempts to dis-
mantle or underfund the United States Postal Service 
and thereby obstruct the passage of the mail as blatant 
tactics of voter suppression and election interference; 
Whereas there is much more work to be done to ensure all 
Americans have the right to vote through free, fair, and 
accessible elections; 
Whereas National Voter Registration Day is September 22; 
and 
Whereas the month of September would be an appropriate 
month to designate as ‘‘National Voting Rights Month’’ 
and ensure our democracy includes all of us through the
