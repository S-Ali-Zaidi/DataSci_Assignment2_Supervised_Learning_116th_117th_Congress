SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Concentration in the food and agricultural 
3
economy, including mergers, acquisitions, and other 
4
combinations and alliances among suppliers, pack-
5
ers, integrators, other food processors, distributors, 
6
and retailers has been accelerating at a rapid pace 
7
since the 1980s, and particularly since the 2007 
8
through 2009 recession. 
9
(2) The trend toward greater concentration in 
10
food and agriculture has important and far-reaching 
11
implications not only for family farmers, but also for 
12
food chain workers, the food we eat, the commu-
13
nities we live in, and the integrity of the natural en-
14
vironment upon which we all depend. 
15
(3) In the past three decades, the top 4 largest 
16
pork packers have seized control of 71 percent of the 
17
market, up from 36 percent. Over the same period, 
18
the top 4 beef packers have expanded their market 
19
share from 32 percent to 85 percent. The top 4 flour 
20
millers have increased their market share from 40 
21
percent to 64 percent. The market share of the top 
22
4 soybean crushers has jumped from 54 percent to 
23
79 percent, and the top 4 wet corn processors con-
24
trol of the market has increased from 63 percent to 
25
86 percent. 
26
19:59 Jun 12, 2019

•HR 2933 IH
(4) Today the top 4 sheep, poultry, and fluid 
1
milk processors now control 57 percent, 53 percent, 
2
and 50 percent of the market, respectively. 
3
(5) The top 4 grain companies today control as 
4
much as 90 percent of the global grain trade. 
5
(6) During the past 2 years there has been a 
6
wave of consolidation among global seed and crop- 
7
chemical firms, 3 companies now control nearly 2⁄3 
8
of the world’s commodity crop seeds. Those same 3 
9
companies now also control nearly 70 percent of all 
10
agricultural chemicals and pesticides. 
11
(7) In the United States, the 4 largest corn 
12
seed sellers accounted for 85 percent of the market 
13
in 2015, up from 60 percent in 2000. Over the past 
14
20 years, the cost for an acre’s worth of seeds for 
15
an average corn farmer has nearly quadrupled, and 
16
the cost of fertilizer has more than doubled. Yet 
17
corn yields increased only 36 percent over that time, 
18
and the price received for the sale of a bushel of 
19
corn increased only 31 percent. 
20
(8) A handful of firms dominate the processing 
21
of every major commodity. Many of them are 
22
vertically integrated, which means that they control 
23
successive stages of the food chain, from inputs to 
24
production to distribution. The growing number and 
25
19:59 Jun 12, 2019
H2933
4 
•HR 2933 IH
scale of cross-border agribusiness and food mergers 
1
have put foreign firms, often with considerable gov-
2
ernment backing, into prominent and even dominant 
3
positions in the United States beef, hog, poultry, 
4
seed, fertilizer, and agrichemical sectors. 
5
(9) Growing concentration of the agricultural 
6
sector has restricted choices for farmers trying to 
7
sell their products. As the bargaining power of agri-
8
business firms over farmers increases, concentrated 
9
agricultural commodity markets are stacked against 
10
the farmer, with buyers of agricultural commodities 
11
often possessing regional dominance in the form of 
12
oligopsony or monopsony relative to sellers of such 
13
commodities. 
14
(10) The high concentration and consolidation 
15
of buyers in agricultural markets has resulted in the 
16
thinning of both cash and futures markets, thereby 
17
allowing dominant buyers to leverage their market 
18
shares to move those markets to the detriment of 
19
family farmers and ranchers. 
20
(11) 
Buyers 
with 
oligopsonistic 
or 
21
monopsonistic power have incentives to engage in 
22
unfair and discriminatory acts that cause farmers to 
23
receive less than a competitive price for their goods. 
24
At the same time, some Federal courts have incor-
25
19:59 Jun 12, 2019
H2933
5 
•HR 2933 IH
rectly required a plaintiff to show harm to competi-
1
tion generally, in addition to harm to the individual 
2
farmer, when making a determination that an un-
3
fair, unjustly discriminatory, deceptive, or pref-
4
erential act exists under the Packers and Stockyards 
5
Act of 1921. 
6
(12) The farmer’s share of every retail dollar 
7
has plummeted from 41 percent in 1950, to less 
8
than 15 percent today, while the profit share for 
9
farm input, marketing, and processing companies 
10
has risen. 
11
(13) While agribusiness conglomerates are post-
12
ing record earnings, farmers are facing desperate 
13
times. Since 2013, net farm income for United 
14
States farmers has fallen by more than half and me-
15
dian on-farm income was negative in 2017 and in 
16
2018 and is expected to be negative again in 2019. 
17
(14) The benefits of low commodity prices are 
18
not being passed on to American consumers. The 
19
gap between what shoppers pay for food and what 
20
farmers are paid is growing wider. 
21
(15) The steadily rising price of food has out-
22
paced growth in incomes for typical workers. Since 
23
the Great Recession, the annual growth of real 
24
19:59 Jun 12, 2019
H2933
6 
•HR 2933 IH
prices for food at the supermarket have risen nearly 
1
3 times faster than typical earnings. 
2
(16) There is growing consensus that economic 
3
consolidation contributes to the widening gap in eco-
4
nomic opportunity in the United States and bigger, 
5
more dominant firms are more likely to deliver prof-
6
its to investors than to raise wages or benefits. 
7
Mega-mergers in the food and agribusiness indus-
8
tries can lead to growing monopsony power abuse re-
9
sulting in wage suppression, along with massive lay-
10
offs as companies shutter factories and facilities, 
11
harming working families and communities. 
12
(17) Concentration, low prices, anticompetitive 
13
practices, and other manipulations and abuses of the 
14
agricultural economy are driving small family farm-
15
ers out of business. Farmers are going bankrupt or 
16
giving up, and few are taking their places; more 
17
farm families are having to rely on other jobs to stay 
18
afloat. Eighty-three percent of farm household in-
19
come is expected to come from off-farm work this 
20
year, up from 53 percent in 1960. 
21
(18) Eighty-one percent of America’s farmed 
22
cropland is now controlled by 15 percent of farms, 
23
and the number of farmers leaving the land will con-
24
19:59 Jun 12, 2019
H2933

•HR 2933 IH
tinue to increase unless and until these trends are 
1
reversed. 
2
(19) The decline of small family farms under-
3
mines the economies of rural communities across 
4
America; it has pushed Main Street businesses, from 
5
equipment suppliers to small banks, out of business 
6
or to the brink of insolvency. 
7
(20) Increased concentration in the agribusiness 
8
sector has a harmful effect on the environment; cor-
9
porate hog farming, for example, threatens the in-
10
tegrity of local water supplies and creates noxious 
11
odors in neighboring communities. Concentration 
12
also can increase the risks to food safety and limit 
13
the biodiversity of plants and animals. 
14
(21) The decline of family farming poses a di-
15
rect threat to American families and family values, 
16
by subjecting farm families to turmoil and stress. 
17
Farm advocates across the country are reporting an 
18
increase in farmer suicides over the past several 
19
years. 
20
(22) The decline of family farming causes the 
21
demise of rural communities, as stores lose cus-
22
tomers, churches lose congregations, schools and 
23
clinics become under-used, career opportunities for 
24
19:59 Jun 12, 2019
H2933
8 
•HR 2933 IH
young people dry up, and local inequalities of wealth 
1
and income grow wider. 
2
(23) These developments are not the result of 
3
inevitable market forces. Its problems arise rather 
4
from policies made in Washington, including farm, 
5
antitrust, and trade policies. 
6
(24) Past congressional action to remediate 
7
market failure, such as enacting country-of-origin la-
8
beling to provide transparency for domestic farmers, 
9
ranchers, and consumers regarding agricultural com-
10
modity origins, have been overturned for key com-
11
modities by oligopolistic conglomerates that use un-
12
differentiated imports to reduce domestic farm 
13
prices. 
14
(25) To restore competition in the agricultural 
15
economy, and to increase the bargaining power and 
16
enhance economic prospects for family farmers, the 
17
trend toward concentration must be reversed.

(A) competition in markets for their prod-
