SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Public confidence in the Federal Govern-
3
ment is based on the expectation that officers and 
4
employees will discharge their duties impartially, and 
5
avoid either actual conflicts of interest or the ap-
6
pearance thereof. 
7
(2) The risk of an actual conflict of interest, or 
8
the appearance thereof, arises when a nominee or 
9
appointee to a Senate-confirmed position or an indi-
10
vidual in a position of a confidential or policymaking 
11
character has previously donated to, solicited for, or 
12
received funds from a political action committee or 
13
entity organized under section 501(c)(4) or section 
14
501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
15
(3) Since the 2010 decision by the Supreme 
16
Court of the United States in Citizens United v. 
17
Federal Election Commission, spending by corpora-
18
tions subject to Federal laws and regulations has in-
19
creased dramatically. 
20
(4) While some corporate political spending is 
21
done publicly, contributions to entities organized 
22
under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue 
23
Code of 1986 need not be disclosed, making this 
24
spending effectively anonymous. The risk of an ac-
25
tual conflict of interest, or the appearance thereof, 
26
05:10 Feb 05, 2019
H812
3 
•HR 812 IH
arises whether political spending is public or anony-
1
mous. 
2
(5) Current financial disclosure requirements do 
3
not require filers to report funds they have donated 
4
to, solicited for, or received from political action 
5
committees or entities organized under section 
6
501(c)(4) or section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Rev-
7
enue Code of 1986. 
8
(6) Apparent or actual conflicts of interest are 
9
best ameliorated through public disclosure of this ac-
10
tivity to the Office of Government Ethics so the ap-
11
parent or actual conflicts can be addressed in ethics 
12
agreements negotiated between the filer and the 
13
agency in which the filer will serve.
