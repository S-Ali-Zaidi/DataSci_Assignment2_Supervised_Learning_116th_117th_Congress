SEC. 11. COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF IMPLICATIONS 
1
ON USE OF MID-LEVEL ETHANOL BLENDS. 
2
(a) DEFINITION OF MID-LEVEL ETHANOL BLEND.— 
3
In this section, the term ‘‘mid-level ethanol blend’’ means 
4
an ethanol-gasoline blend that— 
5
(1) contains more than 10 but not more than 
6
20 percent ethanol by volume; and 
7
(2) is intended to be used in any conventional, 
8
gasoline-powered— 
9
(A) onroad, nonroad, or marine engine; or 
10
(B) onroad or nonroad vehicle. 
11
(b) ASSESSMENT.— 
12
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Administrator, acting 
13
through the Assistant Administrators of the Office 
14

16
(A) not later than 45 days after the date 
17

18
ment with the National Academy of Sciences 
19

20
Assistant Administrators, by not later than 18 
21
months after that date of enactment, a com-
22
prehensive assessment of the scientific and 
23

24
the use of mid-level ethanol blends, as com-
25
pared to the use of gasoline blends containing
