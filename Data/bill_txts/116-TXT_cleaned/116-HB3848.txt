SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) During the 20-year period preceding the 
3
date of enactment of this Act, activity by private eq-
4
uity funds has exploded. 
5
(2) Millions of people in communities across the 
6
United States rely on companies that are owned by 
7
private equity funds, including almost 5,800,000 in-
8
dividuals who work for companies owned by those 
9
funds. For millions of additional individuals, a pri-
10
vate investment fund acts as a landlord, a lender, or 
11
an owner of a local grocery store, newspaper, or hos-
12
pital. Many pension funds are also investors in pri-
13
vate investment funds. 
14
(3) Private investment funds have taken con-
15
trolling stakes in companies in a wide variety of in-
16
dustries, including the financial services, real estate, 
17
media, and healthcare industries, but some of the 
18
largest impacts from private investment funds have 
19
been in the retail sector. In the 2 years preceding 
20
the date of enactment of this Act, cases have been 
21
commenced under title 11, United States Code, with 
22
respect to dozens of retailers in the United States, 
23
including Sears, Toys ‘‘R’’ Us, Shopko, Payless 
24

ShoeSource, Charlotte Russe, Bon-Ton, Nine West, 
1
David’s Bridal, Claire’s, and Southeastern Grocers, 
2
which was the parent company for BI–LO and 
3
Winn-Dixie. 
4
(4) Private investment funds have also targeted 
5
entities that serve low-income or vulnerable popu-
6
lations, including affordable housing developments, 
7
for-profit colleges, payday lenders, medical providers, 
8
and nursing homes. 
9
(5) While private investment funds often pur-
10
port to take over struggling companies and make 
11
those companies viable, the opposite is often true. 
12
Leveraged buyouts impose enormous debt loads on 
13
otherwise viable companies and then strip those 
14
companies of assets, hobbling the operations of those 
15
companies and preventing them from making nec-
16
essary investments for future growth. If an invest-
17
ment goes well, the fund reaps most of the rewards, 
18
but if the investment does not go well, workers and 
19
customers of the company, and the community rely-
20
ing on the company, suffer. 
21
(6) Regardless of the performance of a private 
22
investment fund, the managers of the fund often 
23
make profits through fees, dividends, and other fi-
24
nancial engineering. Private funds should have a 
25
22:24 Jul 23, 2019
H3848
5 
•HR 3848 IH
stake in the outcome of their investments, enjoying 
1
returns if those investments are successful but ab-
2
sorbing losses if those investments fail. 
3
(7) When a case is commenced under title 11, 
4
United States Code, with respect to a portfolio com-
5
pany, workers not only lose jobs, but also lose wages 
6
and benefits that are owed, severance pay that has 
7
been promised, and pensions that have been earned. 
8
Workers should not be sent to the back of the line 
9
behind other creditors if, through no fault of those 
10
workers, an investment fails. 
11
(8) The performance of private investment 
12
funds is cloaked in secrecy. Those funds have full 
13
control over the information that the funds disclose 
14
to investors, which allows the funds to manufacture 
15
their own performance metrics and makes it difficult 
16
for an investor to compare the returns to other in-
17
vestment options. Funds also increasingly require in-
18
vestors to waive the fiduciary obligations applicable 
19
to the funds. Investors should have the information 
20
and bargaining power to take control over their own 
21
investments. 
22
(9) An increasing amount of risky debt is being 
23
introduced into the market and the quality of that 
24
debt is deteriorating, raising concerns with regu-
25
22:24 Jul 23, 2019
H3848
6 
•HR 3848 IH
lators and lawmakers about systemic risk. The insti-
1
tutions that make and securitize risky loans collect 
2
large fees and then pass on risk to unwitting inves-
3
tors. The financial system should not bear all of the 
4
risk while lenders and securitizers reap the rewards. 
5
(10) The Federal Government should— 
6
(A) protect workers, companies, con-
7
sumers, and investors in the United States; and 
8
(B) put an end to the practice of looting 
9
of economically viable companies for the enrich-
10
ment of private investment fund managers.
