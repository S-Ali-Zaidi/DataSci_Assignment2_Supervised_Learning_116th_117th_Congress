A BILL 
To improve the integrity and safety of horseracing by requir-
ing a uniform anti-doping and medication control pro-
gram to be developed and enforced by an independent 
Horseracing Anti-Doping and Medication Control Au-
thority. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Horseracing Integrity 
2
Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Recognizing the substantial relation that 
6
horseracing has to interstate commerce, Congress 
7
enacted the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 (15 
8
U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) to regulate pari-mutuel wager-
9
ing on horseracing in order to protect and further 
10
the horseracing industry of the United States. This 
11
Act does not modify or supplement the Interstate 
12
Horseracing Act of 1978 or impair or restrict the 
13
operation and enforcement of State law or regulation 
14
of horseracing with respect to matters unrelated to 
15
anti-doping and medication control or for violations 
16
of State or Federal criminal law. 
17
(2) Approximately 40 percent of the 635,890 
18
starts by Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse, and 
19
Standardbred racehorses in 2018 were made by 
20
horses that competed in more than one State. Those 
21
Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse, and Standardbred 
22
racehorses which participated in races in more than 
23
one State in 2018 made over 55 percent of all 
24
United States racing starts that year.

•HR 1754 IH
(3) Uniform adoption of national anti-doping 
1
and medication control standards for horseracing in 
2
the United States will promote interstate commerce, 
3
encourage fair competition and a level playing field, 
4
assure full and fair disclosure of information to pur-
5
chasers of breeding stock and to the wagering pub-
6
lic, will improve the marketplace for domestic and 
7
international sales of United States horses, will pro-
8
vide a platform for consistency with all major inter-
9
national horseracing standards, address growing do-
10
mestic concerns over disparities with international 
11
rules, and provide for the safety and welfare of 
12
horses and jockeys. 
13
(4) The use of therapeutic medications in horse-
14
racing in the United States must place the health 
15
and welfare of the horse at the highest level of pri-
16
ority while achieving consistency with the uses per-
17
mitted in major international horseracing jurisdic-
18
tions. Because the various States have been unable 
19
to adopt a national uniform anti-doping and medica-
20
tion control program, national uniform regulations 
21
with respect to the use of, and testing for, drugs ca-
22
pable of affecting the results of a horse race and 
23
therapeutic medications used in horseracing, such 
24
rules, procedures, and enforcement policies should be 
25
23:36 Apr 03, 2019

•HR 1754 IH
implemented, consistent with internationally accept-
1
ed best practices, by an independent anti-doping and 
2
medication control organization authorized by an act 
3
of Congress. 
4
(5) For human sports, Congress has dem-
5
onstrated its commitment to fair competition 
6
through legislation, oversight, funding, and by its 
7
execution of an international treaty, the UNESCO 
8
International Convention Against Doping in Sport. 
9
By ratifying the UNESCO Convention, the United 
10
States agreed to adopt appropriate measures con-
11
sistent with the principles of the World Anti-Doping 
12
Code and to take appropriate action, including legis-
13
lation, regulation, policies, or administrative prac-
14
tices to implement that commitment. 
15
(6) In the context of Olympic sports, Congress 
16
has recognized the United States Anti-Doping Agen-
17
cy as an independent anti-doping and medication 
18
control organization possessing high-level expertise 
19
and credibility in the development and administra-
20
tion of an anti-doping and medication control pro-
21
gram. 
22
(7) Congress supports the establishment of an 
23
independent anti-doping and medication control or-
24
ganization to ensure the wagering public’s con-
25

•HR 1754 IH
fidence in the fairness of horseracing and to 
1
strengthen and harmonize anti-doping and medica-
2
tion control rules and sanctions for horseracing in 
3
order to ensure fair and transparent horseraces and 
4
to deter the commission of anti-doping and medica-
5
tion control rule violations. 
6
(8) The movement of horses among the States 
7
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
participating 
in 
covered 
8
horseraces, the widespread acceptance, receipt, and 
9
transmission of wagers on covered horseraces in 
10
interstate commerce, and the need to ensure integ-
11
rity of competition in, and wagering on, covered 
12
horseraces warrant congressional action as set forth 
13
in this Act.
