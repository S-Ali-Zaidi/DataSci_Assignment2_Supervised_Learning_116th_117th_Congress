A BILL 
To amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize 
the use of funds for comprehensive reproductive health 
care services, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Abortion is Health 
4
Care Everywhere Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 7816 IH
(1) Abortion is a critical component of sexual 
1
and reproductive health care and should be acces-
2
sible and affordable for all people. 
3
(2) All people have the right to make their own 
4
choices about their sexual and reproductive health, 
5
and to access quality and affordable sexual and re-
6
productive health care. International agreements 
7
have recognized reproductive rights for over 25 
8
years, and the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals 
9
reiterated the centrality of reproductive rights to 
10
gender equality. 
11
(3) Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that 
12
when people, including young women and adolescent 
13
girls, 
gender 
non-conforming 
individuals, 
and 
14
transgender men, are able to control their reproduc-
15
tive lives, there are enormous social and economic 
16
benefits—not just for the individual and their fam-
17
ily, but for entire communities. Countries that 
18
prioritize reproductive health, rights, and justice and 
19
human rights are more likely to have better overall 
20
health throughout. 
21
(4) Health system cost is reduced when abor-
22
tion is widely available and integrated with other 
23
types of health care.

•HR 7816 IH
(5) Without access to safe abortion care, people 
1
risk their lives to end their pregnancies. At least 
2
24,100 people in low- and middle-income countries 
3
die every year from complications from unsafe abor-
4
tion. 
5
(6) Ninety-seven percent of unsafe abortions 
6
occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and 
7
Latin America. In low- and middle-income countries, 
8
the annual cost of post-abortion care for all who 
9
need it would be $4 billion. The majority of this cost 
10
is attributed to treating complications from abor-
11
tions provided in unsafe conditions. 
12
(7) Restricting abortion does not reduce either 
13
the need for or number of abortions. Abortion rates 
14
are similar in countries where it is highly restricted 
15
by law and where it is broadly legal. 
16
(8) When abortions are performed in accord-
17
ance with World Health Organization (WHO) guide-
18
lines and standards, there is minimal risk of severe 
19
complications or death. 
20
(9) As part of their commitment to prevent un-
21
safe abortions and preventable deaths and ensure all 
22
people have access to comprehensive sexual and re-
23
productive health care and can exercise their right to 
24
full control over their sexuality and reproduction, de-

veloping countries and donor governments must 
1
work collaboratively to deploy funding, align policies, 
2
and mobilize expertise to make safe abortion services 
3
available to those seeking to terminate pregnancies. 
4
(10) United States law restricting United 
5
States foreign assistance funding from being used to 
6
provide safe abortion services has the effect of harm-
7
ing people who seek to terminate their pregnancies 
8
in several ways, including by blocking access to serv-
9
ices and erecting barriers to providers obtaining the 
10
training and equipment needed to deliver care to 
11
those in need. 
12
(11) Since section 104(f)(1) of the Foreign As-
13
sistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(f)(1)) (com-
14
monly referred to as the ‘‘Helms amendment’’) was 
15
enacted in 1973, dozens of governments across the 
16
globe have liberalized abortion laws and policies. 
17
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
18
The following shall be the policy of the United States 
19
Government: 
20
(1) Safe abortion is a critical component of 
21
comprehensive maternal and reproductive health 
22
care and should be included as part of foreign assist-
23
ance programs funded by the United States Govern-
24
ment.

(2) Safe abortion is to be made widely available 
1
and integrated with other types of health care.

(3) The United States Government should work 
3
to end unsafe abortion and promote safe abortion 
4
services by providing funding and collaborating with 
5
affected governments and service providers to pro-
6
vide training, commodities and equipment, and ac-
7
cess to safe abortion services.
