1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Americans cherish the continued existence 
8
of expansive, unspoiled wilderness ecosystems and 
9
wildlife found on their public lands and feel a strong 
10
moral responsibility to protect this wilderness herit-
11
age as an enduring resource to bequeath undis-
12
turbed to future generations of Americans. 
13
(2) It is widely believed by ecologists, wildlife 
14
scientists, public land specialists, and other experts 
15
that the wilderness ecosystem centered around and 
16
dependent upon the Arctic coastal plain of the Arctic 
17
National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, represents the 
18
very epitome of a primeval wilderness ecosystem and 
19
constitutes the greatest wilderness area and diversity 
20
of wildlife habitats of its kind in the United States.

(3) President Dwight D. Eisenhower initiated 
1
protection of the wilderness values of the Arctic 
2
coastal plain in 1960 when he set aside 8,900,000 
3
acres establishing the Arctic National Wildlife Range 
4
expressly ‘‘for the purpose of preserving unique wild-
5
life, wilderness and recreational values’’. 
6
(4) When the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 
7
was established in 1980 by paragraph (2) of section 
8
303 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Con-
9
servation Act (Public Law 96–487; 94 Stat. 90; 23 
10
16 U.S.C. 668dd note), subparagraph (B) recog-
11
nized the following four additional purposes of the 
12
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: 
13
(A) ‘‘To conserve fish and wildlife popu-
14
lations and habitats in their natural diversity 
15
including the Porcupine caribou herd’’. 
16
(B) ‘‘To fulfill the international treaty obli-
17
gations for the United States with respect to 
18
fish and wildlife and their habitats’’. 
19
(C) ‘‘To provide . . . the opportunity for 
20
continued subsistence use by local residents’’. 
21
(D) ‘‘To ensure . . . water quality and 
22
quantity within the refuge’’. 
23
(5) A majority of Americans have supported 
24
and continue to support preserving and protecting

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including the 
1
Arctic coastal plain, from any industrial development 
2
and consider oil and gas exploration and develop-
3
ment in particular to be incompatible with the pur-
4
poses for which this incomparable wilderness eco-
5
system has been set aside. 
6
(6) Canada has taken action to preserve those 
7
portions of the wilderness ecosystem of the Arctic 
8
that exist on its side of the international border and 
9
provides strong legal protection for the habitat of 
10
the Porcupine caribou herd that migrates annually 
11
through both countries to calve on the Arctic coastal 
12
plain. 
13
(7) The Gwich’in people of eastern Alaska and 
14
Northwestern Canada have relied on the Porcupine 
15
caribou herd for millennia and caribou is a vital cul-
16
tural, spiritual, and nutritional resource for the 
17
Gwich’in. 
18
(8) The Arctic is being impacted by climate 
19
change at unprecedented levels. Temperatures are 
20
rising at twice the rate of the rest of the country, 
21
and wildlife and habitat that depend on the Arctic 
22
are being detrimentally impacted.

would allow an oil and gas program on the Coastal 
1
Plain. Oil and gas activities are not compatible with 
2
the protection of this national treasure. 
3
(10) Repeal of section 20001 would best protect 
4
the unspoiled ecosystem of the Coastal Plain, the 
5
human rights of the Gwich’in, and the integrity of 
6
the National Wildlife Refuge System.

12
ecosystem of the Arctic coastal plain; 
13
(2) to sustain this natural treasure for the cur-
14
rent generation of Americans;
