patching the stored energy; and 
11
(B)(i) uses a mechanical, electrochemical, 
12
or thermal process to store energy that— 
13
(I) was generated at an earlier time 
14
for use at a later time; or 
15
(II) was generated from a mechanical 
16
process, and would otherwise be wasted, 
17
for delivery at a later time; or 
18
(ii) stores thermal energy for direct use for 
19
heating or cooling at a later time in a manner 
20
that avoids the need to use electricity at that 
21
later time, including the storage and use offered 
22
by a grid-enabled water heater. 
23
(3) ISLAND.—The term ‘‘island’’, with respect 
24

power from a primary source. 
3
(4) MICROGRID.—The term ‘‘microgrid’’ means 
4
an interconnected system of loads and distributed 
5
energy resources, including generators and energy

respect to the grid; and 
10
(B) can connect and disconnect from the

17
(6) RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE.—The term 
18
‘‘rural electric cooperative’’ means an electric coop-
