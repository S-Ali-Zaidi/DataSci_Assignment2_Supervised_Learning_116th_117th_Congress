A BILL 
To direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency to seek to enter an agreement with the National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to 
conduct a study on the science of background ozone 
in the United States and to provide research rec-
ommendations to better understand background ozone 
contributions to ground-level ozone, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Background Ozone Re-
2
search Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Ground-level ozone, a type of tropospheric 
6
ozone, is created when nitrogen oxides (NOX) and 
7
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), emitted by 
8
motor vehicles, power plants, other industrial proc-
9
esses, or natural processes like wildfires, chemically 
10
react in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) radiation 
11
from the Sun. 
12
(2) Ground-level ozone present in a given area 
13
may be attributed to either local, human produced 
14
sources or sources that are not local and human pro-
15
duced. 
16
(3) United States background ozone (hereafter 
17
referred to as ‘‘background ozone’’) is the ground- 
18
level ozone that would exist in the absence of any 
19
human-produced emissions inside the United States. 
20
(4) Ground level ozone is considered a harmful 
21
pollutant due to its effects on people and the envi-
22
ronment and is the main component of smog. 
23
(5) The American Thoracic Society estimated 
24
the annual excess mortality due to ground-level 
25

ozone in the United States at 3,880 individuals as 
1
of 2017. 
2
(6) Ground-level ozone has been linked to plant 
3
damages and thus diminished crop yields. 
4
(7) A number of cities and regions in the 
5
United States remain out of compliance with Envi-
6
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Ambi-
7
ent Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground- 
8
level ozone. 
9
(8) Further research would help to understand 
10
background ozone trends and how to mitigate back-
11
ground ozone. 
12
SEC. 3. STUDY ON BACKGROUND OZONE RESEARCH NEEDS. 
13
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days after the 
14
date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the 
15
Environmental Protection Agency shall seek to enter an 
16
agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engi-
17
neering, and Medicine (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘Na-
18
tional Academies’’) under which the National Academies 
19
shall conduct a study on the current and future research 
20
needs regarding background ozone. The study shall— 
21
(1) propose a framework of standard terms and 
22
definitions for types of non-local ground level ozone, 
23
including types of background ozone, to standardize 
24
research on ground-level ozone;

(2) examine the current understanding of back-
1
ground sources of ozone and the contribution of such 
2
sources to ground-level ozone in the United States to 
3
identify gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed 
4
with additional research; 
5
(3) examine challenges in quantifying the 
6
sources of background ozone and the contributions 
7
of each such source to ground-level ozone on a re-
8
gional scale in the United States and identifies spe-
9
cific research needs to address these challenges; 
10
(4) include an outline of a plan for a research 
11
and development program, including specifications 
12
for costs, timeframes, and responsible agencies, to 
13
support analysis and demonstration of background 
14
ozone trends, including by— 
15
(A) improving collection and observational 
16
infrastructure; 
17
(B) improving confidence in model outputs; 
18
(C) reducing uncertainties in estimates of 
19
background ozone; and 
20
(D) making background ozone research 
21
outputs more useful and accessible to decision- 
22
makers; and 
23
(5) identify opportunities for international en-
24
gagement that may facilitate increased research col-

laborations that improve understanding of ozone

trends.

(b) REPORT.—As a condition of any agreement under 
3
subsection (a), the Administrator shall require that the 
4
National Academies transmit to Congress a report on the 
5
results of the study under subsection (a) not later than 
6
24 months after the date of enactment of this Act.
