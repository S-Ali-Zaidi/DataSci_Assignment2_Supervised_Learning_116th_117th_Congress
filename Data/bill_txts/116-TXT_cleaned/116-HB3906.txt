A BILL 
To prohibit the expansion of immigration detention facilities, 
to improve the oversight of such facilities, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLES. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Detention Oversight, 
4
Not Expansion Act’’ or the ‘‘DONE Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Despite a significant decrease in border ap-
8
prehensions, the Federal immigrant detention sys-
9
tem expanded dramatically between 1994 and 2019, 
10

•HR 3906 IH
with the average daily population of detained non-
1
citizens increasing from fewer than 7,000 during fis-
2
cal year 1994 to approximately 48,000 during fiscal 
3
year 2019. This population consists of increasing 
4
numbers of children and women, including pregnant 
5
women and asylum seekers. 
6
(2) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
7
ment (referred to in this section as ‘‘ICE’’) inspec-
8
tions of detention facilities are performed by field of-
9
fices, facility staff, or divisions within ICE head-
10
quarters and are not conducted by qualified inde-
11
pendent third parties. Since the inspectors are not 
12
independent, they often misrepresent conditions in-
13
side the facilities and rarely impose consequences for 
14
violations. For example, an outside review of 8 facili-
15
ties concluded that although ICE identified viola-
16
tions of medical standards as contributing factors to 
17
deaths in detention, routine ICE detention facility 
18
inspections before and even after the deaths failed to 
19
acknowledge (and even dismissed) those violations. 
20
(3) Multiple Federal oversight bodies, including 
21
the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of 
22
Inspector General, ICE’s Advisory Committee on 
23
Family Residential Centers, and the Government Ac-
24
countability Office, have documented poor conditions 
25
04:16 Aug 02, 2019

•HR 3906 IH
and inhumane detainee treatment, including medical 
1
negligence, in immigration detention facilities. State 
2
oversight bodies, including the Office of the Attorney 
3
General of California, have also noted abuses at de-
4
tention centers within their borders. 
5
(4) Since 2003, more than 170 deaths have 
6
been reported in immigration detention facilities, a 
7
significant number of which resulted from egregious 
8
violations of ICE medical care standards, which were 
9
often overlooked during ICE inspections of facilities. 
10
Since the inauguration of President Trump, more 
11
than 24 people have died in ICE custody. 
12
(5) The Department of Homeland Security Of-
13
fice for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Of-
14
fice of Inspector General have received formal com-
15
plaints and numerous allegations of inadequate med-
16
ical care for pregnant women who are in custody in 
17
such facilities. 
18
(6) Responses by the Department of Homeland 
19
Security to Freedom of Information Act requests 
20
suggest that fewer than 3 percent of the claims of 
21
sexual and physical abuse of detainees in such facili-
22
ties have been investigated by the Office of Inspector 
23
General. 
24

•HR 3906 IH
(7) Multiple Federal oversight bodies, including 
1
the Homeland Security Advisory Council, have docu-
2
mented limited oversight and management account-
3
ability of immigration detention facilities, including 
4
a lack of reasonable inspections and deficient con-
5
tracting practices. 
6
(8) Some immigration detention facilities have 
7
unreasonably restricted visitation and access by at-
8
torneys and community groups in violation of appli-
9
cable requirements, raising serious due process con-
10
cerns. 
11
(9) The Department of Homeland Security 
12
seeks to vastly expand the immigration detention 
13
system despite the availability of a wide array of 
14
community-based alternatives to detention that pro-
15
vide cheaper, more compassionate, rights-respecting 
16
responses to migration. 
17
(10) Although the Family Case Management 
18
Program operated at a fraction of the cost of deten-
19
tion and resulted in nearly a 100 percent compliance 
20
rate among participants, the Department of Home-
21
land Security terminated the program without pro-
22
viding any justification.
