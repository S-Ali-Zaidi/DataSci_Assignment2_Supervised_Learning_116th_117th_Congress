RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for frontline workers, residents of long- 
term care facilities, individuals with preexisting condi-
tions, and K–12 educators to receive priority access to 
a COVID–19 vaccine. 
Whereas during a global pandemic that has claimed the lives 
of over a million individuals, certain sectors of the popu-
lation are at a higher risk due to underlying health com-
plications or disproportionate exposure to COVID–19; 
Whereas COVID–19 has taken the lives of senior citizens, es-
pecially those living in nursing homes and long-term care 
facilities, at a disproportionate rate; 
Whereas we have called on our frontline workers to serve 
their country during this pandemic, putting themselves at 
greater risk of exposure to COVID–19;

Whereas frontline workers have answered this call and car-
ried out their critical missions to protect the health and 
safety of our communities and to minimize the disruption 
that COVID–19 has caused to our daily lives; 
Whereas doctors, nurses, home care and domestic workers, 
and other medical professionals have put themselves in 
harm’s way to care for their patients, COVID–19 or oth-
erwise; 
Whereas critical infrastructure workers have continued to 
meet their existing responsibilities to maintain safety and 
public health while overcoming staggering new challenges 
presented by the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the health and safety of the Nation’s K–12 public 
and private school educators are vital to the education 
and development of students, which is foundational to the 
continued prosperity and strength of the United States; 
and 
Whereas in-person learning allows students to develop knowl-
edge, problem-solving and critical social and emotional 
skills: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
