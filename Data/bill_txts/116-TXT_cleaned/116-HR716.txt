Whereas other coastal regions in the United States are vul-
nerable to flooding and coastal hazards, and the applied 
research and partnership structure developed in the Vir-
ginia can be replicated throughout the Nation, increasing 
community resilience and national security; 
Whereas the universities convened State, local, regional, non-
profit, and private sector partners to develop relation-
ships and began the process of building new strategies to 
respond to increasing coastal threats; 
Whereas the universities have a proven record of accomplish-
ment and natural and social scientific expertise in coastal 
flooding and are located in a natural test bed at the 
mouth of the Chesapeake Bay; 
Whereas the designation made by this resolution will further 
the ability of these university partners to collaborate with 
relevant Federal agencies on flood-related topics and 
share best practices with stakeholders in and outside Vir-
ginia; 
Whereas maintaining the facility and personnel readiness at 
bases and Federal facilities in Virginia, including Norfolk 
Naval Station, Marine Corps Base Quantico, Naval Sur-
face Warfare Center Dahlgren, and Joint Expeditionary 
Base Langley Eustis, which are vulnerable to flooding 
and coastal hazards, is essential to our Nation’s national 
security; and 
Whereas the universities have a history of working with Fed-
eral agencies in coastal flooding and convening stake-
holders, and are legislatively designated jointly by the 
Commonwealth of Virginia as a provider of technical and 
scientific advice: Now, therefore, be it
