•HR 281 IH
(1) while significant progress has occurred due 
1
to the antidiscrimination amendments to the Federal 
2
Reserve Act, barriers continue to pose significant ob-
3
stacles for candidates reflective of gender diversity 
4
and racial or ethnic diversity for Federal Reserve 
5
bank president positions in the Federal Reserve Sys-
6
tem; 
7
(2) the continuing barriers described in para-
8
graph (1) merit the following amendment; 
9
(3) Congress has received and reviewed testi-
10
mony and documentation of the historical lack of 
11
gender, racial, and ethnic diversity from numerous 
12
sources, including congressional hearings, scientific 
13
reports, reports issued by public and private agen-
14
cies, news stories, and reports of related barriers by 
15
organizations and individuals, which show that 
16
race-, ethnicity-, and gender-neutral efforts alone are 
17
insufficient to address the problem; 
18
(4) the testimony and documentation described 
19
in paragraph (3) demonstrate that barriers across 
20
the United States prove problematic for full and fair 
21
participation in developing monetary policy by indi-
22
viduals reflective of gender diversity and racial or 
23
ethnic diversity; and

(5) the testimony and documentation described

is a compelling need for the below amendment to ad-
3
