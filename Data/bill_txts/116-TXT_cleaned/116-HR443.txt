RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon 
landing, and for other purposes. 
Whereas, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy an-
nounced before a special joint session of Congress the 
dramatic and ambitious goal of sending an American 
safely to the Moon before the end of the decade; 
Whereas, on July 20, 1969, NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong 
took the historic first steps on the Moon and declared, 
‘‘That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for man-
kind’’; 
Whereas NASA built upon knowledge gleaned from the Mer-
cury and Gemini programs that included sending astro-
nauts into orbit from Cape Canaveral and most of them 
splashing down off the coast of Florida;

Whereas the first 4 crewed Apollo flights tested the equip-
ment used in the Apollo program, with the first flight in 
1968 and the last in 1972; 
Whereas the first Apollo crew, Gus Grissom, Ed White, and 
Roger Chaffee, lost their lives in the line of service as 
they conducted a simulation on the launch pad in Flor-
ida, a flash fire broke out in their spacecraft; 
Whereas a total of 11 crewed Apollo missions were conducted 
from Kennedy Space Center in Florida with 6 lunar mod-
ules making a landing on the Moon and a total of 12 as-
tronauts walking on the Moon; 
Whereas women and minorities were instrumental in the suc-
cess of the Apollo 11 mission; 
Whereas Margaret Hamilton, the head of the Software Engi-
neering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, 
the first software engineer, led the development of Apollo 
flight software; 
Whereas Katherine Johnson, a pioneering African-American 
mathematician and the first woman to work in Langley 
Research Center’s Flight Research Division to receive 
credit as author of a research report, did the pioneering 
work to enable the rendezvous in lunar orbit that made 
Apollo 11 possible; 
Whereas Susan Finley began her career as a computer pro-
grammer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and wrote 
software for the Deep Space Network that enabled the 
transmission of Armstrong’s famous words: ‘‘One small 
step for man, one giant leap for mankind’’; 
Whereas Frances ‘‘Poppy’’ Northcutt, the first female engi-
neer in NASA’s Mission Control Center in Houston, was 
integral to the success of the Apollo program;

Whereas the Apollo missions laid the foundation for modern 
planetary science and built a legacy for future scientists; 
Whereas discoveries made during the Apollo missions are still 
being applied, with thousands of scientific papers pub-
lished using Apollo data; 
Whereas the Apollo project not only fulfilled Kennedy’s goal 
of landing a man on the Moon, but also achieved his dip-
lomatic goal of Cold War rivals working together when in 
1975, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project saw the last Apollo 
spacecraft dock with a Soviet Soyuz, and crews conducted 
joint operations in orbit; 
Whereas NASA established the technology to meet national 
interests in space, achieving preeminence in space for the 
United States by carrying out a program of scientific ex-
ploration of the Moon; 
Whereas NASA is now committed to returning to the Moon 
in a sustainable way, with innovative new technologies 
and systems to explore more locations across the surface 
than were ever thought possible, and this time, when we 
go to the Moon, we will stay; 
Whereas NASA’s science, technology, and human exploration 
activities touch every aspect of our lives; 
Whereas 
the 
space 
industry 
generates 
more 
than 
$400,000,000,000 in economic activity; 
Whereas in Florida alone, the space industry impact totals 
$19,000,000,000 annually and 130,000 jobs; and 
Whereas more than 1,700,000 people visited the Kennedy 
Space Center’s Visitor Complex in 2018 to view many 
rocket launches and see the space shuttle Atlantis, the 
Saturn V rocket, Apollo 14 command module, and
