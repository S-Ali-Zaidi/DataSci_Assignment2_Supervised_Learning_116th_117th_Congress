SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Overdraft coverage is a form of short-term 
3
credit that depository institutions provide for con-
4
sumer transaction accounts. Historically, depository 
5
institutions covered overdrafts for a fee on an ad hoc 
6
basis. 
7
(2) With the growth in specially designed soft-
8
ware programs and in consumer use of debit cards, 
9
overdraft coverage for a fee has become more preva-
10
lent. 
11
(3) Many depository institutions offer a range 
12
of overdraft options but aggressively encourage con-
13
sumers to consent to the most expensive option, 
14
where a high flat fee is collected for every individual 
15
overdraft transaction. 
16
(4) Most depository institutions collect a high 
17
flat fee, including for small dollar transactions, each 
18
time the institution covers an overdraft, in some 
19
cases impose multiple overdraft coverage fees within 
20
a single day, and many charge additional fees for 
21
each day during which the account remains over-
22
drawn. 
23
(5) Such abusive practices in connection with 
24
overdraft coverage fees have deprived consumers of 
25
meaningful choices about their accounts and placed 
26
01:58 Sep 10, 2019
H4254

•HR 4254 IH
significant financial burdens on low- and moderate- 
1
income consumers. 
2
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to pro-
3
tect consumers by limiting abusive overdraft coverage fees 
4
and practices, and by providing meaningful disclosures 
5
and consumer choice in connection with overdraft coverage 
6
fees.
