A BILL 
To counter White identity terrorism globally, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) ‘‘White Identity Terrorism’’ is the term 
5
used by the Department of State to encompass 
6
White nationalist and White supremacist terrorists. 
7
Individuals who adhere to White nationalist and 
8
White supremacist ideologies share a common belief

•HR 7345 IH
that White people and ‘‘White identity’’ in western 
1
countries are under siege and pursue the destruction 
2
of pluralistic values intrinsic to the American way of 
3
life. 
4
(2) The Global Terrorism Database and cor-
5
responding Global Terrorism Index has recorded a 
6
rise in the number and lethality of White identity 
7
terrorist incidents over the past decade domestically 
8
and internationally. 
9
(3) Various individuals, networks, and organiza-
10
tions fall under the umbrella of the global White 
11
identity terrorist movement, whose adherents are be-
12
coming increasingly internationalized, with fighters 
13
and terrorist ideology moving across borders. 
14
(4) Irresponsible social media site are enabling 
15
the internationalization of the White identity ter-
16
rorist movement in terms of organization and re-
17
cruitment. State and nonstate actors have helped to 
18
build a global, online White identity terrorist echo 
19
chamber, including by translating terrorist mani-
20
festos and promoting other violent extremist content. 
21
This includes countries using troll farms to exacer-
22
bate fears of immigrants, Muslims, Jews, and other 
23
minorities in western countries among potentially 
24
sympathetic audiences.

•HR 7345 IH
(5) There is evidence that adherents of the 
1
White identity movement in the United States are 
2
increasingly traveling overseas for training, further 
3
contributing to the internationalization of White 
4
identity terrorism. Jihadist experiences in Afghani-
5
stan, Iraq, and Syria highlight the dangers that such 
6
individuals can pose because of the connections and 
7
capabilities they bring with them when they return 
8
home. 
9
(6) The global White identity terrorist move-
10
ment has manifested a decentralized organizational 
11
approach that encourages individuals to operate 
12
independently from one another and execute ter-
13
rorist attacks on their own. This approach poses 
14
challenges to law enforcement efforts to track, mon-
15
itor, and disrupt planned violence. In the same way 
16
that Islamist terrorists have looked to figures in al- 
17
Qaeda and the Islamic State, White identity terror-
18
ists draw on one another for inspiration. 
19
(7) The growing global interconnectivity of the 
20
White identity terrorist movement means that the 
21
United States must confront this threat as part of 
22
an integrated, whole-of-government approach.
