SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Under section 2576a of title 10, United 
3
States Code, the Department of Defense is author-
4
ized to provide excess property to local law enforce-
5
ment agencies. The Defense Logistics Agency ad-
6
ministers such section by operating the Law En-
7
forcement Support Office (referred to in this Act as 
8
‘‘LESO’’) program. 
9
(2) New and used material, including mine-re-
10
sistant ambush-protected vehicles and weapons de-
11
termined by the Department of Defense to be ‘‘mili-
12
tary grade’’ are transferred to Federal, State, tribal, 
13
and local law enforcement agencies through the pro-
14
gram. 
15
(3) As of September 30, 2019, the Department 
16
of Defense, through the LESO, as reported through 
17
public 
information, 
has 
transferred 
18
$1,796,844,591.74 worth of equipment with over 
19
1,474,319 units of goods. 
20
(4) Research has shown that as transfers of 
21
militarization equipment increase in States, reputa-
22
tion of police officers decreases and the increased 
23
equipment shows no change in the crime rate. 
24
(5) Research shows that police officers are more 
25
likely to be harmed by civilians when States receive 
26

certain transfers and police frequently engage in vio-
1
lent actions against civilians. 
2
(6) On January 16, 2015, President Barack 
3
Obama issued Executive Order 13688 to better co-
4
ordinate and regulate the Federal transfer of mili-
5
tary weapons and equipment to State, local, and 
6
tribal law enforcement agencies and stated that ‘‘the 
7
show of force typically associated with military oper-
8
ations, when employed by civilian police, can weaken 
9
community trust, especially in communities with a 
10
history of strained relationships between the commu-
11
nity and local law enforcement’’. 
12
(7) In July 2017, the Government Account-
13
ability Office reported that the program’s internal 
14
controls were inadequate to prevent fraudulent appli-
15
cants’ access to the program.
