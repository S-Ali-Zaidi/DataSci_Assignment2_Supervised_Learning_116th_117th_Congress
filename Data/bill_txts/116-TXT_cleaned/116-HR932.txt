Whereas the first celebration of Earth Day was the largest 
environmental grassroots event ever held at that time and 
is widely credited with launching the modern environ-
mental movement; 
Whereas the voices of inaugural Earth Day participants gal-
vanized an unparalleled period of legislative and grass-
roots activity that changed the way we interact with the 
environment, leading to the creation of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, and passage of legislation 
such as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the 
Endangered Species Act; 
Whereas, by 1990, Earth Day was celebrated globally, with 
200,000,000 people in 141 countries participating in 
Earth Day events; 
Whereas, on April 22, 2016, the 46th anniversary of Earth 
Day, 175 world leaders signed the Paris Agreement, a 
landmark international agreement to combat climate 
change and accelerate actions and investment in a sus-
tainable, clean energy future; 
Whereas the 50th anniversary of Earth Day will be marked 
by tens of thousands of engagement events in every coun-
try across the world; 
Whereas Earth Day fosters environmental activism and stew-
ardship around the world, and encourages people to find 
ways to protect the environment, including managing 
their own environmental impact; 
Whereas on Earth Day, people engage in projects, initiatives, 
and campaigns to protect and restore the planet includ-
ing planting trees, removing litter, cleaning up coral 
reefs, conserving water and energy, and other environ-
mentally responsible actions;

Whereas in recognition of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, 
the Earth Challenge 2020 was launched, a global citizen 
science initiative to demonstrate how small acts of science 
can add up to global change; 
Whereas new and continuing challenges, including climate 
change, pollution, sea level rise, and loss of forests, wet-
lands, and other wildlife habitats, reinforce the need for 
adequate protections for the air we breathe, the water we 
drink, the land we inhabit, and the animals we live along-
side; 
Whereas there is scientific consensus that climate change 
poses a dire threat to our planet and its inhabitants, and 
that urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to 
mitigate its worst effects; 
Whereas Earth Day reaffirms our national responsibility in 
the global effort to combat climate change and protect 
our planet for all; 
Whereas Earth Day encourages us to acknowledge the preva-
lence of environmental injustices that directly affect the 
health and well-being of individuals and communities 
across the country, and affirms our commitment to ame-
liorating existing environmental injustices, and to pre-
venting future injustices; 
Whereas Earth Day reminds us of the need to expand envi-
ronmental and climate literacy not only to strengthen en-
vironmental and climate protections but also to accelerate 
development of green technologies and creation of green 
jobs that will benefit all communities; and 
Whereas Earth Day reminds us we must not pass a world be-
yond repair to our children: Now, therefore, be it
