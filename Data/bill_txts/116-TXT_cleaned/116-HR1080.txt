onstration in Jacksonville, Florida, history; 
Whereas several brave activists—many teenagers—hosted a 
sit-in at a Jacksonville Whites-only lunch counter, where 
they endured verbal and physical abuse from White cus-
tomers;

Whereas after weeks of peaceful lunch counter protests, a vio-
lent backlash occurred; 
Whereas Jacksonville NAACP President Rutledge Pearson, 
Jacksonville Youth Council NAACP member Rodney 
Hurst, and other community activists fought for social 
injustice by demonstrating at Hemming Park; 
Whereas rioters planted and passed out ax handles and began 
brutally beating the demonstrators on what is now known 
as Ax Handle Saturday; 
Whereas it was reported that authorities stood idly by, leav-
ing citizens and the peaceful protestors comprised of 
young students defenseless in the face of the violent mob; 
Whereas the activists confronted racist laws and discrimina-
tory practices, and risked their lives and reputations at 
Hemming Park, to dismantle Jim Crow policies; 
Whereas there are only three survivors still alive, Spencer 
Meeks, Rodney Hurst, and Marjorie Meeks Brown; and 
Whereas this year is the 60-year anniversary of Ax Handle 
Saturday: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
