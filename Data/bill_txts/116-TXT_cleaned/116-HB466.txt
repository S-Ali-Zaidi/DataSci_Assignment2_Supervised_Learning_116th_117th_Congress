A BILL 
To direct the Federal Communications Commission to amend 
its rules so as to prohibit the application to amateur 
stations of certain private land use restrictions, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Amateur Radio Parity 
4
Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 466 IH
(1) More than 730,000 radio amateurs in the 
1
United States are licensed by the Federal Commu-
2
nications Commission in the amateur radio services. 
3
(2) Amateur radio, at no cost to taxpayers, pro-
4
vides a fertile ground for technical self-training in 
5
modern telecommunications, electronics technology, 
6
and emergency communications techniques and pro-
7
tocols. 
8
(3) There is a strong Federal interest in the ef-
9
fective performance of amateur stations established 
10
at the residences of licensees. Such stations have 
11
been shown to be frequently and increasingly pre-
12
cluded by unreasonable private land use restrictions, 
13
including restrictive covenants. 
14
(4) Federal Communications Commission regu-
15
lations have for three decades prohibited the applica-
16
tion to stations in the amateur service of State and 
17
local regulations that preclude or fail to reasonably 
18
accommodate amateur service communications, or 
19
that do not constitute the minimum practicable reg-
20
ulation to accomplish a legitimate State or local pur-
21
pose. Commission policy has been and is to require 
22
States and localities to permit erection of a station 
23
antenna structure at heights and dimensions suffi-
24

cient to accommodate amateur service communica-
1
tions. 
2
(5) The Commission has sought guidance and 
3
direction from Congress with respect to the applica-
4
tion of the Commission’s limited preemption policy 
5
regarding amateur service communications to private 
6
land use restrictions, including restrictive covenants. 
7
(6) There are aesthetic and common property 
8
considerations that are uniquely applicable to private 
9
land use regulations and the community associations 
10
obligated to enforce covenants, conditions, and re-
11
strictions in deed-restricted communities. These con-
12
siderations are dissimilar to those applicable to State 
13
law and local ordinances regulating the same resi-
14
dential amateur radio facilities. 
15
(7) In recognition of these considerations, a 
16
separate Federal policy than exists at section 
17
97.15(b) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, is 
18
warranted concerning amateur service communica-
19
tions in deed-restricted communities. 
20
(8) Community associations should fairly ad-
21
minister private land use regulations in the interest 
22
of their communities, while nevertheless permitting 
23
the installation and maintenance of effective outdoor 
24
amateur radio antennas. There exist antenna de-

signs and installations that can be consistent with 
1
the aesthetics and physical characteristics of land 
2
and structures in community associations while ac-
3
commodating communications in the amateur radio 
4
services.

SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF PRIVATE LAND USE RESTRIC-
6
TIONS TO AMATEUR STATIONS. 
7
(a) AMENDMENT OF FCC RULES.—Not later than 
8
120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
9
Federal Communications Commission shall amend section 
10
97.15 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by adding 
11
a new paragraph that prohibits the application to amateur 
12
stations of any private land use restriction, including a 
13
restrictive covenant, that— 
14
(1) on its face or as applied, precludes commu-
15
nications in an amateur radio service; 
16
(2) fails to permit a licensee in an amateur 
17
radio service to install and maintain an effective out-
18
door antenna on property under the exclusive use or 
19
control of the licensee; or 
20
(3) does not constitute the minimum practicable 
21
restriction on such communications to accomplish 
22
the lawful purposes of a community association seek-
23
ing to enforce such restriction.

(b) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.—In amending its 
1
rules as required by subsection (a), the Commission 
2
shall— 
3
(1) require any licensee in an amateur radio 
4
service to notify and obtain prior approval from a 
5
community association concerning installation of an 
6
outdoor antenna; 
7
(2) permit a community association to prohibit 
8
installation of any antenna or antenna support 
9
structure by a licensee in an amateur radio service 
10
on common property not under the exclusive use or 
11
control of the licensee; and 
12
(3) subject to the standards specified in para-
13
graphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a), permit a com-
14
munity association to establish reasonable written 
15
rules concerning height, location, size, and aesthetic 
16
impact of, and installation requirements for, outdoor 
17
antennas and support structures for the purpose of 
18
conducting communications in the amateur radio 
19
services.
