RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 100th anniversary of Disabled American 
Veterans. 
Whereas Disabled American Veterans of the World War (now 
DAV—Disabled American Veterans) was founded on 
September 25, 1920, and chartered by Congress on June 
17, 1932, in recognition of the role of the organization 
as the official voice of the Nation’s wartime disabled vet-
erans; 
Whereas in 2020, DAV celebrates 100 years of serving vet-
erans, their families, survivors, and communities; 
Whereas DAV is the largest wartime veterans service organi-
zation in the United States made up exclusively of men 
and women disabled in defense of the Nation with ap-
proximately 1,000,000 service-disabled veterans in its

Whereas the National Headquarters of DAV is located in 
Kentucky, its National Service and Legislative Head-
quarters is located in Washington, DC, and 52 depart-
ments and 1,344 chapters are located throughout the 
United States; 
Whereas since its founding, DAV has served American vet-
erans wounded, injured, or made ill due to military serv-
ice by advocating for the establishment of the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs and by fighting in the halls of 
Congress for benefits and services for service-disabled 
veterans; 
Whereas in 1920, DAV began representing the interests of 
veterans and subsequently developed a professional na-
tional service officer corps that has made DAV the Na-
tion’s preeminent provider of claims assistance to injured 
and ill American veterans, their families, and their sur-
vivors; 
Whereas DAV co-presents the National Disabled Veterans 
Winter Sports Clinic and the National Disabled Veterans 
Training Exposure Experience Tournament, has orga-
nized a nationwide transportation network providing free 
transportation to Department of Veterans Affairs medical 
facilities for injured and ill veterans, operates an active 
charitable service trust funding the needs of local pro-
viders assisting at-risk local veterans, maintains an active 
volunteer corps providing thousands of hours of service to 
veterans and communities, and created the Jesse Brown 
Memorial Youth Scholarship program to contribute to the 
lives of young Americans; 
Whereas DAV has championed important programs for im-
proving the lives of all veterans, including the establish-
ment of a cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs,

the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, a modernized 
appeals process, an advanced appropriation to ensure 
adequate and timely funding for Department of Veterans 
Affairs health care, family caregivers’ benefits, and the

Whereas DAV continues to advocate and create awareness for 
many issues affecting veterans, including equitable bene-
fits and services for women veterans, appropriate re-
sources for mental health, suicide prevention services, 
and benefits for all veterans exposed to toxic substances: 
Now, therefore, be it

5
tinues to do so;
