A BILL 
To eliminate any subsidies for flood insurance coverage under 
the National Flood Insurance Program for new construc-
tion, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Build for Future Dis-

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) According to the National Oceanic and At-
8
mospheric Administration, since 2000, flooding has 
9
become the most common and costly natural disaster

in the United States, impacting all 50 States and 
1
causing more than $845 billion in damage. 
2
(2) A 2019 report from the California-based 
3
analytics company CoreLogic found that 7.3 million 
4
homes along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts alone are 
5
at risk from storm surge, with a potential $1.8 tril-
6
lion in reconstruction costs. 
7
(3) Research from New York University’s 
8
Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy 
9
estimated that, in 2015, 15 million people nation-
10
wide lived in the 100-year floodplain spread across 
11
coastal and inland States. 
12
(4) The National Flood Insurance Program 
13
(NFIP), administered by the Federal Emergency 
14
Management Agency (FEMA), provides federally 
15
backed flood insurance in over 22,000 communities 
16
in 56 States and jurisdictions in the United States 
17
with more than 5 million policies providing over $1.3 
18
trillion in coverage. 
19
(5) In 1966, while calling for the creation of 
20
the NFIP, the Task Force on Federal Flood Control 
21
Policy provided ‘‘a caution on flood insurance’’ that 
22
if ‘‘incorrectly applied, it could exacerbate the whole 
23
problem of flood losses.’’. The report warned that in-
24
surance coverage not proportionate to risk would 
25

•HR 8616 IH
‘‘invite economic waste of great magnitude . . . ag-
1
gravate flood damages and constitute gross public ir-
2
responsibility’’. 
3
(6) According to the Government Accountability 
4
Office (GAO), the NFIP offers 20 percent of policy-
5
holders heavily subsidized rates that FEMA esti-
6
mates may be 45 to 50 percent below a full-risk 
7
rate. 
8
(7) Since 2005, the NFIP has borrowed nearly 
9
$40 billion from taxpayers to meet policyholder in-
10
surance claims. 
11
(8) In 2017, the Congressional Budget Office 
12
estimated that under its current model the NFIP is 
13
expected to lose $1.3 billion a year. 
14
(9) Historically, repeatedly flooded properties 
15
have accounted for just 1 percent of properties with 
16
National Flood Insurance Program policies but 
17
about 25 to 30 percent of flood claims. Nationwide 
18
more than 150,000 properties have repeatedly flood-
19
ed at a cost to the NFIP of more than $12.5 billion. 
20
(10) On May 26, 2019, four former FEMA Ad-
21
ministrators wrote a letter to Congressional leaders 
22
stating: ‘‘Change is needed to allow the NFIP to pay 
23
off its debt and serve its purposes of reducing Fed-
24
eral disaster spending following flood events, mini-

mizing flood losses, and discouraging unwise build-
1
ing in flood-prone areas.’’. 
2
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Gov-
4
ernment should— 
5
(1) discourage regulation and policies that re-
6
sult in building and rebuilding homes located in high 
7
flood-risk areas; 
8
(2) limit the availability of federally subsidized 
9
flood insurance for construction of new homes, busi-
10
ness, and infrastructure; 
11
(3) coordinate with floodplain managers, city 
12
planners, administrators, and local elected officials 
13
to ensure that structures built in flood-prone areas 
14
comply with building and elevation codes and regula-
15
tions that are designed to reduce their risk of dam-
16
age from flooding; and 
17
(4) prioritize increased mitigation funding 
18
through new and existing programs to help commu-
19
nities better prepare for future flood disasters before 
20
they happen.

SEC. 4. ELIMINATION OF SUBSIDIES FOR NEW CONSTRUC-
1
TION. 
2
Subsection (c) of section 1308 of the National Flood 
3
Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4015(c)) is amended 
4
by adding at the end the following new paragraph: 
5
‘‘(3) NEW CONSTRUCTION.—Any property the 
6
construction or substantial improvement of which 
7
the Administrator determines has been started on or 
8
after January 1, 2025, and the appropriate actuarial 
9
rate shall be adjusted with any changes to the flood 
10
zone or base flood elevation reflected in relevant 
11
flood insurance rate map, regardless of the previous 
12
rating; in determining whether a property is subject 
13
to this paragraph, the Administrator shall consider 
14
the issue date for any relevant building permit or oc-
15
cupancy certificate issued by the community in 
16
which such property is located; for purposes of this 
17
paragraph only, a determination regarding substan-
18
tial improvement may exclude the costs of any im-
19
provement to a structure or the structure’s associ-
20
ated land area for which the primary purpose is 
21
flood mitigation or floodproofing; such improvements 
22
may include elevation of the building or utilities, 
23
floodproofing, or other site-specific mitigation activi-
24
ties that would otherwise meet the eligibility require-

SEC. 5. GAO STUDY AND REPORT. 
3
The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
4
conduct a study to determine the feasibility and effects 
5
of— 
6
(1) eliminating, by January 1, 2027, all sub-
7
sidies that reduce premiums for coverage under the 
8
National Flood Insurance Program of the Federal 
9
Emergency Management Agency to amounts that 
10
are less than the amount that is actuarially nec-
11
essary for such Program to operate without a deficit; 
12
and 
13
(2) prohibiting any subsidy described in para-
14
graph (1) for any property unless mitigation activi-
15
ties to decrease the risk of flood damage to such 
16
property have been completed. 
17
Not later than the expiration of the 12-month period be-
18
ginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
19
Comptroller General shall submit a report to the Congress 
20
that describes the findings of the study pursuant to this 
21
section.
