CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) continues 
to make an invaluable contribution to United States and 
international security, and noting former Senator Rich-
ard G. Lugar’s indispensable contributions to inter-
national security and reducing nuclear weapons-related 
risks. 
Whereas the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons (NPT) opened for signature 50 years ago on 
July 1, 1968; 
Whereas the United States and the former Soviet Union 
averted a catastrophic nuclear exchange during the Octo-

ber 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, which led to a series of 
bilateral and multilateral agreements to lessen the chance 
of nuclear war, including the NPT; 
Whereas President John F. Kennedy predicted in 1963 that 
as many as 25 countries would acquire nuclear weapons 
by 1970 absent a treaty to control nuclear weapons; 
Whereas the United States Senate provided its advice and 
consent to the NPT on March 13, 1969, with a vote on 
ratification of 83 to 15; 
Whereas the NPT has grown to include 191 State Parties, 
making an irreplaceable contribution to international se-
curity by preventing the spread of nuclear weapons; 
Whereas former Senator Richard G. Lugar made indispen-
sable contributions to reducing nuclear weapon risks, 
most notably through his leadership in standing up the 
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Nunn-Lugar Program’’), which elimi-
nated 7,600 nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union; 
Whereas Senator Lugar successfully secured the advice and 
consent of the Senate to the Treaty between the United 
States of America and the Russian Federation on Meas-
ures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Stra-
tegic Offensive Arms, signed at Prague April 8, 2010, 
and entered into force February 5, 2011 (commonly 
known as the ‘‘New START Treaty’’); 
Whereas Article III of the NPT obligates each nonnuclear 
weapon state to the NPT to conclude a Safeguards 
Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to verify treaty compliance, 174 of which are 
Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements crafted to detect

the diversion of nuclear materials from peaceful to non- 
peaceful uses; 
Whereas the 2018 Department of Defense Nuclear Posture 
Review affirms, ‘‘The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) is a cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. It plays a positive role in building consensus for 
non-proliferation and enhances international efforts to 
impose costs on those that would pursue nuclear weapons 
outside the Treaty.’’; 
Whereas the success of the NPT has and will continue to de-
pend upon the full implementation by all State Parties of 
the Treaty’s three mutually reinforcing pillars: non-
proliferation, access to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 
and disarmament; 
Whereas, over the past half century, the United States has 
exhibited leadership in strengthening each of the NPT’s 
three pillars for the global good, including— 
(1) reducing its nuclear weapons stockpile by more 
than 85 percent from its Cold War heights of 31,225 in 
parallel with equally massive reductions of the Russian 
Federation’s stockpile through bilateral coordination; 
(2) cooperating with Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and 
Belarus to facilitate the surrender of nuclear weapons on 
their soil after the fall of the Soviet Union—leading to 
each country’s accession to the NPT as nonnuclear weap-
ons states; 
(3) providing voluntary contributions to the IAEA to 
promote 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities 
exceeding 
$378,000,000 since 2010, including activities that help in 
the treatment of cancer and other life-saving applications; 
and

(4) extending deterrence to United States allies in 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Japan, 
and the Republic of Korea—which is an unmistakable 
demonstration of the United States commitment to col-
lective security; 
Whereas heightened geopolitical tensions in recent years have 
made cooperation on nonproliferation and arms control 
issues with the Russian Federation more challenging; 
Whereas a range of actions by the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation has led to a deterioration in bilateral re-
lations with the United States, including Russia’s brazen 
interference in the 2016 United States presidential elec-
tions, its violation of the Treaty between the United 
States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
publics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range 
and Shorter-Range Missiles (commonly known as the 
‘‘INF Treaty’’), signed at Washington, DC, December 8, 
1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988, its use of a 
chemical nerve agent in an assassination attempt against 
Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the United 
Kingdom in March 2018, its illegal annexation of Cri-
mea, its invasion of Eastern Ukraine, and its desta-
bilizing actions in Syria; 
Whereas, within a difficult environment, preserving agree-
ments that continue to contribute to United States and 
global security, particularly the New START Treaty, is 
important, and that to that end, the Department of State 
confirmed in February 2018 that Russia had met New 
START’s Central Treaty Limits and stated that ‘‘imple-
mentation of the New START Treaty enhances the safe-
ty and security of the United States’’;

Whereas United States efforts to reduce dangers associated 
with nuclear arsenals through ambitious arms control 
agreements with both the Russian Federation and the 
People’s Republic of China would advance United States 
and global security, adding to the benefits of stability and 
transparency provided by existing agreements; 
Whereas, in a March 2018 speech, President Vladimir Putin 
of the Russian Federation unveiled details of new kinds 
of strategic nuclear weapons under development, includ-
ing hypersonic nuclear weapons, nuclear-powered ballistic 
missiles, and multi-megaton nuclear torpedoes shot from 
drone submarines that may be accountable under the 
New START Treaty; 
Whereas the Russian Federation erroneously claimed that the 
United States may have not reached New START Treaty 
central limits by February 5, 2018, as is mandated by 
the Treaty; 
Whereas the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) is the 
appropriate forum for the Parties to engage construc-
tively on any New START Treaty implementation issues 
that arise; and 
Whereas the collapse of the INF Treaty and expiration of the 
New START Treaty would lead to the absence of any 
binding, bilateral treaty or agreement governing United 
States and Russian nuclear forces, which account for 90 
percent of those currently in existence globally, for the 
first time since 1972: Now, therefore be it
