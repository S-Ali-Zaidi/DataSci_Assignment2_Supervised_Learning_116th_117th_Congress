on January 1, 1863, and months after the conclusion of 
the Civil War; 
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major 
General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, 
with news that the Civil War had ended and that the 
enslaved were free; 
Whereas African Americans who had been slaves in the 
Southwest celebrated June 19th, commonly known as 
‘‘Juneteenth Independence Day’’, as the anniversary of 
their emancipation; 
Whereas African Americans from the Southwest continue the 
tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as 
inspiration and encouragement for future generations; 
Whereas for more than 150 years, Juneteenth Independence 
Day celebrations have been held to honor African-Amer-
ican freedom while encouraging self-development and re-
spect for all cultures; and 
Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by 
former slaves remains an example for all people of the 
United States, regardless of background, religion, or 
race: Now, therefore, be it
