10

‘‘(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
18
‘‘(A) With the dramatic growth in pretrial 
19
detention resulting in county and city correc-
20
tional facilities regularly exceeding capacity, 
21
such correctional facilities may serve to rapidly 
22
increase the spread of COVID–19, as facilities 
23
that hold large numbers of individuals in 
24
congregant living situations may promote the 
25
spread of COVID–19.

‘‘(B) While individuals arrested and proc-
1
essed at local correctional facilities may only be

held for hours or days, exposure to large num-
3
ber of individuals in holding cells and court-
4
