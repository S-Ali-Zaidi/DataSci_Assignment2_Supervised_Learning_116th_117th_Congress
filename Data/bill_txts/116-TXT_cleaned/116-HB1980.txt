SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Since its founding, the United States has 
3
greatly benefitted from the contributions of women. 
4
(2) Historical accounts, monuments, memorials, 
5
and museums disproportionately represent men’s 
6
achievements and contributions and often neglect 
7
those of women. For example— 
8
(A) a study of 18 American history text-
9
books concluded that 10 percent of the material 
10
documented contributions of women; 
11
(B) 9 statues out of 91 in the United 
12
States Capitol’s National Statuary Hall depict 
13
women; and 
14
(C) only one of the 44 monuments oper-
15
ated by the National Park Service specifically 
16
honors the achievements of women after the 
17
2016 designation of the Belmont-Paul Women’s 
18
Equality National Monument. 
19
(3) There exists no national museum in the 
20
United States that is devoted to the documentation 
21
of women’s contributions throughout the Nation’s 
22
history. 
23
(4) Establishing a comprehensive women’s his-
24
tory museum representing a diverse range of view-
25
points, experience, and backgrounds is necessary to
