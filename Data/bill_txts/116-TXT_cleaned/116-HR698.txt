RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives on 
the importance of assisting justice-involved veterans. 
Whereas almost 200,000 veterans are incarcerated; 
Whereas more than half of justice-involved veterans have ei-
ther a mental health issue or a substance abuse disorder; 
Whereas a substantial number of justice-involved veterans are 
homeless or at risk for homelessness; 
Whereas many veterans have difficulty finding work and re-
integrating into society after living in formalized environ-
ments;

Whereas veterans who get involved in the criminal justice sys-
tem may be at a higher risk for suicide; 
Whereas justice-involved veterans in prison cannot receive 
medical services furnished by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, but may receive outreach services; 
Whereas justice-involved veterans have more specialized needs 
upon reentry into society; 
Whereas veterans treatment courts serve only veterans who 
are charged with nonviolent crimes and are in need of 
mental health or substance abuse treatment; 
Whereas prosecutors work with defense attorneys to negotiate 
whether a veteran’s case should be heard in the treat-
ment court, and veterans go through counseling funded 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs; 
Whereas once the veteran finishes the program, which can 
last from a few months to years, all charges are dropped; 
and 
Whereas only approximately 500 counties have veterans 
treatment courts: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the expansion of the veterans 
2
treatment court program; 
3
(2) encourages deeper studies into the efficacy 
4
of these programs and best practices; and 
5
(3) reaffirms the commitment of the House of 
6
Representatives to helping all veterans reintegrating 
7
to civilian life.
