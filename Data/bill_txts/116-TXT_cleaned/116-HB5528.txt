•HR 5528 IH
(1) Under title IV of the Higher Education Act 
1
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.), in 2017–2018 in-
2
stitutions of higher education received funds in ex-
3
cess of $184.1 billion for Federal student support, 
4
including approximately $28.2 billion in Federal Pell 
5
Grants and over $40 billion in research grants. 
6
(2) Under title IV of the Higher Education Act 
7
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.), in fiscal year 
8
2019 approximately $130.4 billion of Federal stu-
9
dent support was available for higher education, in-
10
cluding over $29 billion in Federal Pell Grants. 
11
(3) Many institutions of higher education volun-
12
tarily participate in athletic governance associations. 
13
(4) The largest athletic governance association 
14
includes over 1,100 institutions of higher education 
15
and more than 430,000 student athletes. This asso-
16
ciation generates over $1 billion annually and in 
17
2017–2018 it provided $609,000,000 in revenue 
18
sharing to Division 1 member institutions of higher 
19
education. 
20
(5) In 2018, intercollegiate athletic programs 
21
generated approximately $14 billion in revenue from 
22
ticket sales, radio and television receipts, alumni 
23
contributions, guarantees, royalties, and athletic gov-
24
ernance associations. This is a 226-percent increase 
25
17:27 Dec 29, 2019
H5528

•HR 5528 IH
from 2003 when the revenue generated by such in-
1
stitutions was approximately $4 billion. 
2
(6) Most institutions of higher education are 
3
tax-exempt organizations whose donors benefit from 
4
tax-exempt contributions, including contributions re-
5
stricted by donors to support intercollegiate athletic 
6
programs. 
7
(7) Most intercollegiate athletic programs are 
8
heavily subsidized by the institution of higher edu-
9
cation that they represent, including support 
10
through institutional general funds, mandatory stu-
11
dent fees, and athletic capital projects that benefit 
12
from tax-exempt bonds. 
13
(8) The highest paid public employee in 41 out 
14
of 50 States is a head coach of an intercollegiate 
15
athletic program. 
16
(9) Many intercollegiate athletics programs 
17
have built lavish locker rooms, practice facilities, 
18
competition facilities, and other facilities to entice 
19
talented high school student athletes to attend the 
20
institution of higher education, even though access 
21
to such facilities are restricted from use by non-stu-
22
dent athletes. 
23
(10) Serious questions have arisen regarding 
24
whether institutions of higher education with highly 
25
17:27 Dec 29, 2019
H5528
4 
•HR 5528 IH
commercialized intercollegiate athletic programs fol-
1
low academic standards in admitting student ath-
2
letes, have adequate faculty oversight to ensure that 
3
student athletes are provided a quality education, 
4
have encouraged student athletes to consider the 
5
long-term consequences of athletic related injuries, 
6
provided student athletes access to comprehensive 
7
healthcare programs, and ensure that student ath-
8
letes have the same academic and employment op-
9
portunities as non-student athletes attending the in-
10
stitution of higher education.
