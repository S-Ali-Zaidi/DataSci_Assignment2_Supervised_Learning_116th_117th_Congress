RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of 2019 as the 
‘‘International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical 
Elements’’. 
Whereas, on December 20, 2017, the United Nations General 
Assembly designated 2019 as the ‘‘International Year of 
the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements’’ (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘International Year of the Periodic 
Table’’), recognizing that— 
(1) the development of the periodic table was 1 of 
the most significant achievements in science; and 
(2) the periodic table is a uniting scientific concept 
with broad applications and implications in astronomy, 
chemistry, physics, biology, and other natural sciences;

Whereas the International Year of the Periodic Table will co-
incide with the 150th anniversary of the development of 
the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869; 
Whereas the periodic table is a unique tool enabling scientists 
to predict the appearance and properties of matter on 
Earth and in the universe; 
Whereas the International Year of the Periodic Table pro-
vides an opportunity to educate the public about the ways 
in which chemical elements can help to address chal-
lenges relating to water, food, health, security, and en-
ergy throughout the world; 
Whereas it is critical that the brightest young minds continue 
to be attracted to chemistry and other branches of 
science in order to ensure the development of the next 
generation of scientists, engineers, and innovators; 
Whereas the American Chemical Society, founded in 1876 
and chartered by Congress in 1938, is committed to— 
(1) improving the lives of people through the trans-
forming power of chemistry; and 
(2) advancing the broader chemistry enterprise and 
the practitioners of that enterprise for the benefit of 
Earth and people around the world; and 
Whereas the American Chemical Society and other chemical 
societies and associations around the world are encour-
aging the members of those societies and associations to 
work with colleagues to organize outreach activities that 
will instill public appreciation of— 
(1) the periodic table; and 
(2) the contributions of the periodic table to the bet-
terment of life on Earth: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
