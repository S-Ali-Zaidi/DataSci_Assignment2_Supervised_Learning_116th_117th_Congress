SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The Northern Triangle countries of El Sal-
3
vador, Honduras, and Guatemala have among the 
4
highest homicide rates in the world. In 2017, there 
5
were 60 homicides per 100,000 people in El Sal-
6
vador, 43.6 homicides per 100,000 people in Hon-
7
duras, and 26.1 homicides per 100,000 people in 
8
Guatemala. 
9
(2) Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are 
10
characterized by a high prevalence of drug- and 
11
gang-related violence, murder, and crimes involving 
12
sexual- and gender-based violence. The region also 
13
has high rates of domestic violence, child abuse, and 
14
sexual assault. 
15
(3) Central America ranks high among regions 
16
of the world for female homicides. A combined 801 
17
women were victims of homicide in El Salvador, 
18
Honduras, and Guatemala in 2017 alone, according 
19
to the United Nations Office of Drug Control and 
20
Crime. 
21
(4) El Salvador and Honduras are both among 
22
the top 3 countries in the world with the highest 
23
child homicides rates, with more than 22 and 32 
24
deaths per 100,000 children respectively, according 
25

•HR 2836 IH
to the nongovernmental organization Save the Chil-
1
dren. 
2
(5) Thousands of women, children, and families 
3
are fleeing unsafe homes and communities each 
4
month in these countries due to surging violence. 
5
(6) Violent crimes against women and children 
6
are substantially under-reported because the major-
7
ity of victims lack safe access to protection and jus-
8
tice. 
9
(7) Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador gov-
10
ernments allow impunity for perpetrators of violence 
11
against women and children, with less than 10 per-
12
cent of reported cases resulting in conviction. 
13
(8) According to a study conducted by the 
14
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, 
15
childhood experiences with domestic violence in 
16
Latin America are a major risk factor for future 
17
criminal behavior. Fifty-six percent of incarcerated 
18
women and 59 percent of incarcerated men surveyed 
19
experienced intra-familial violence during childhood.
