Fire Protection Association.

4
percent higher rate of deaths from cancer for fire-
5
fighters in comparison to the general population. 
6
(10) The exposure to traumatic events in the 
7
line of duty has led to an estimated 15 percent of 
8
police officers experiencing post-traumatic stress dis-
9
order, according to the United States Department of 
10
Justice’s Office of Community Policing Service’s 
11
newsletter, The Dispatch.

(11) A 2018 survey of 7,000 firefighters in 
13
New York and California found that 19 percent had 
14
experienced suicidal thoughts, and 65 percent are

on the front lines of this crisis, working around the 
1
clock to salvage any lives, land, and property that 
2
they can. 
3
(14) Firefighters have battled physical and 
4
emotional exhaustion, and in some instances given 
5
their lives, while combating the destructive wildfires 
6
on the West Coast. 
7
(15) The mental burden carried by police offi-
8
cers and firefighters is somberly demonstrated by 
9
the statistic that, in 2017, there were more fire-
10
fighter and police officer deaths by suicide than in 
11
the line of duty, according to the Ruderman Family 
12
Foundation. 
13
(16) As of September 2020, there have been at

(20) The serious dangers faced by EMS work-
1
ers during the COVID–19 pandemic are highlighted 
2
by the 36 reported EMS worker deaths from 
3
COVID–19 as of September 17, 2020, according to 
4
EMS1, an online resource for EMTs and Para-
5
medics. 
6
(21) It is the sense of Congress that the sac-
7
rifices made by first responders and frontline work-
8
ers warrants the designation of making October 
9
28th a national holiday entitled ‘‘First Responders 
10
Day’’. 
11
SEC. 2. FIRST RESPONDERS DAY. 
12
Section 6103(a) of title 5, United States Code, is

amended by inserting after the item relating to Columbus 
14
Day, the following: 
15
‘‘First Responders Day.’’.
