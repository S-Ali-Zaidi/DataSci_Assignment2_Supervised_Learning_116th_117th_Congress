RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designating November 2020 National 
Career Development Month. 
Whereas November 2020 marks the 107th year that the Na-
tional Career Development Association (NCDA) is com-
mitted to its mission of inspiring and empowering indi-
viduals to achieve their career and life goals; 
Whereas a competitive global economy requires workers who 
make informed career choices to prepare for skilled pro-
fessions; 
Whereas preparation for a purposeful career path helps to en-
sure gainful employment best utilizing one’s skills and 
talent, while providing potential employers with a well- 
prepared workforce ready to meet the challenges of the 
global marketplace;

Whereas career development programs enable students to 
gain a realistic understanding of how formal education 
prepares them for post-high school plans, which may in-
clude immediate employment in a civilian or military oc-
cupation, or further education at a vocational program, 
community college, or university; 
Whereas career development activities in our communities 
contribute to lower unemployment as people identify ca-
reers that match their interests and desired work envi-
ronments; 
Whereas freedom of occupational and career choice is one of 
the most important birthrights of every United States cit-
izen, and this freedom will be protected and enhanced 
throughout life; 
Whereas professional career development assistance, includ-
ing but not limited to career counseling, should be avail-
able to all persons throughout their lifespans; 
Whereas career development assistance is a community part-
nership effort involving the education system, the home 
and family structure, business, industry, and a wide vari-
ety of community agencies and organizations and is not 
carried out by career development professionals alone; 
Whereas equity, not just equality, of career development op-
portunities should be available for all persons; 
Whereas the right to change occupations or career directions 
is fully as important as the right to choose an occupation 
or career direction; 
Whereas accurate, up-to-date information about educational 
and occupational opportunities is vital;

Whereas helping individuals increase self-understanding of 
their abilities, interests, values, and goals is a vital foun-
dation of the career development process; 
Whereas career professionals help to provide career develop-
ment services to inspire and empower our citizens’ atten-
tion to where it is needed most: empowering the national 
economy through maximum individual productivity; 
Whereas according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, as 
of October 2020, 11,000,000 workers are unemployed; 
Whereas career professionals help the United States worker 
meet the very real and immediate challenges of economic 
development, student achievement, and global competi-
tiveness; 
Whereas career professionals are a vital resource for the live-
lihood of our Nation’s workforce and are underutilized 
relative to their potential need and value; 
Whereas a Harris Interactive Poll, conducted in partnership 
with NCDA, examined the perceptions of today’s work-
force on the effectiveness of career counselors, the need 
for expanded workforce training opportunities and the 
hardships implicit in selecting, changing, or getting a job 
in the current economic climate, and the feedback is very 
clear; and 
Whereas the 2011 Harris Poll results revealed that— 
(1) only one quarter (24 percent) of adults report 
that they have already visited a career practitioner and 
86 percent of those found them to be helpful; and 
(2) only 37 percent of respondents reported making 
a conscious choice when choosing a career while over half 
(56 percent) took the only job available, looked inter-
