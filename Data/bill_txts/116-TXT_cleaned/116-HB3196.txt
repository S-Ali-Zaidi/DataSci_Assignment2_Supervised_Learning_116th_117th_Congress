A BILL 
To designate the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope as the 
‘‘Vera Rubin Survey Telescope’’. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Vera Rubin Survey 
4
Telescope Designation Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Dr. Vera Rubin was born July 23, 1928, to 
8
Philip and Rose Applebaum Cooper.

(2) Dr. Rubin pursued her graduate studies at 
1
Cornell University and Georgetown University, earn-
2
ing her Ph.D. in Physics in 1954. 
3
(3) Dr. Rubin’s Ph.D. thesis on galaxy motions 
4
provided supporting evidence that galaxies are not 
5
uniformly distributed, but exist in clusters. 
6
(4) Dr. Rubin continued to study the motions 
7
of galaxies, first as research associate and assistant 
8
professor at Georgetown University, and then as a 
9
member of the staff at the Carnegie Institution of 
10
Washington Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. 
11
(5) Dr. Rubin faced barriers throughout her ca-
12
reer because of her gender. 
13
(6) For instance, one of the world’s leading as-
14
tronomy facilities at the time, the Palomar Observ-
15
atory, did not permit women. Dr. Rubin persisted 
16
and was finally allowed to observe at Palomar in 
17
1965, the first woman officially allowed to do so. 
18
(7) In 1970, Dr. Rubin published measure-
19
ments of the Andromeda galaxy showing stars and 
20
gas orbiting the galaxy’s center too fast to be ex-
21
plained by the amount of mass associated with the 
22
light output of the stars. 
23
(8) In the years that followed, Dr. Rubin and 
24
her collaborators used their observations, in conjunc-

tion with the work by earlier astronomers on the ro-
1
tation of stars in spiral galaxies, to provide some of 
2
the best evidence for the existence of dark matter. 
3
(9) This work contributed to a major shift in 
4
the conventional view of the universe, from one 
5
dominated by ordinary matter such as what pro-
6
duces the light of stars, to one dominated by dark 
7
matter. 
8
(10) Dr. Rubin was elected to the National 
9
Academy of Sciences in 1981, the second woman as-
10
tronomer to be so honored. 
11
(11) Dr. Rubin was awarded the President’s 
12
National Medal of Science in 1993 ‘‘for her pio-
13
neering research programs in observational cos-
14
mology which demonstrated that much of the matter 
15
in the universe is dark, and for significant contribu-
16
tions to the realization that the universe is more 
17
complex and more mysterious than had been imag-
18
ined’’. 
19
(12) Dr. Rubin was an outspoken advocate for 
20
the equal treatment and representation of women in 
21
science, and she served as a mentor, supporter, and 
22
role model to many women astronomers throughout 
23
her life.

(13) The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, 
1
funded jointly by the National Science Foundation 
2
and the Department of Energy, will honor the legacy 
3
of Dr. Rubin and her colleagues to probe the nature 
4
of dark matter by mapping and cataloging billions of 
5
galaxies through space and time.

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope shall be known

Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document,
