RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the impact and importance of improving preven-
tion, detection, and treatment modalities for African- 
American women with cardiovascular disease and diabe-
tes. 
Whereas cardiovascular disease (CVD)—including coronary 
heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and high blood pres-
sure—is the leading cause of death for men and women 
in the United States; 
Whereas African Americans have a three-fold greater risk of 
developing CVD than all other Americans; 
Whereas according to the American Heart Association, 
among African-American women ages 20 and older, near-
ly half (48.3 percent) already have CVD;

Whereas higher rates of heart attack, sudden cardiac arrest, 
heart failure, and stroke disproportionately affect Afri-
can-American women; 
Whereas CVD kills nearly 50,000 African-American women 
annually, but only one in five African-American women 
believes she is personally at risk; 
Whereas major risk factors for heart disease, including diabe-
tes, smoking, elevated blood pressure, high blood choles-
terol, physical inactivity, obesity, and a family history of 
heart disease, all disproportionately impact Black women; 
Whereas research shows that prolonged exposure to stress, as 
from coping with racism, may produce higher levels of 
the stress hormone cortisol in Black women which can 
lead to higher rates of obesity, thereby increasing the risk 
of heart disease and other chronic illness; 
Whereas cardiovascular disease poses a significant financial 
burden in the form of direct health care costs and lost 
productivity, costing the United States approximately 
$200 billion a year; 
Whereas cardiovascular events such as stroke can cause per-
manent and debilitating damage with only 10 percent of 
stroke survivors making a full recovery; 
Whereas 39.5 million women have prediabetes; 
Whereas diabetes has been linked to cardiovascular illnesses, 
and adult diabetics are more likely to be at risk for heart 
attacks, strokes, and high blood pressure; 
Whereas diabetes has been linked to cardiovascular illnesses; 
Whereas many African-American women with diabetes are 
unaware that having diabetes increases their risk for 
CVD;

Whereas women with diabetes are 40 percent more likely to 
develop heart disease; 
Whereas at least 68 percent of people with diabetes age 65 
and older die of some form of heart disease and 16 per-
cent die from stroke; 
Whereas gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a disease 
characterized by high blood sugar (glucose) levels during 
pregnancy, and it raises a mother’s risk of getting type 
2 diabetes and heart disease later in life; 
Whereas African-American women who develop GDM during 
pregnancy face a 52 percent increased risk of developing 
diabetes in the future compared to White women who de-
velop GDM; and 
Whereas cardiovascular complications are the leading cause 
of pregnancy-related death in Black women: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the importance of decreasing car-

diovascular disease among all populations, especially

among African-American women;

5
African Americans, including racism and stress, 
6
which lead to disproportionately rates of heart dis-
7
ease, stroke, diabetes, and maternal mortality; 
8
(3) promotes the necessity of spreading aware-

ness and improving education about cardiovascular

risk factors and preventive health and lifestyle
