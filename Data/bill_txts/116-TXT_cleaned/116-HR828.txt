RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States Trade Representative should promptly 
resume negotiations to conclude the Environmental 
Goods Agreement. 
Whereas climate change is one of the most serious threats we 
face today; 
Whereas transitioning towards a low-emissions economy must 
be a priority for all countries; 
Whereas, on July 8, 2014, the United States and other mem-
ber countries of the World Trade Organization, account-
ing for nearly 90 percent of global exports in environ-
mental goods, began negotiations on the Environmental 
Goods Agreement;

•HRES 828 IH 
Whereas the Environmental Goods Agreement would elimi-
nate tariffs on a broad range of environmental goods in-
cluding wind turbines, water treatment filters, solar 
water heaters, and bicycles; 
Whereas the United States is a leader in the development of 
environmental goods, but such goods can face tariffs as 
high as 50 percent when exported to other countries; and 
Whereas the negotiations represent a significant opportunity 
to help countries across the world access high-quality af-
fordable environmental goods while also leveling the play-
ing field for American manufacturers and supporting 
green jobs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that not later than 90 days after the date of 
2
the adoption of this Resolution, the United States Trade

Representative should resume negotiations to conclude the

Environmental Goods Agreement.
