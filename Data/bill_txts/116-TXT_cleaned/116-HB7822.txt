A BILL 
To protect clean air and public health by expanding fenceline 
and ambient air monitoring and access to air quality 
information for communities affected by air pollution; 
to require immediate toxic air monitoring at the fenceline 
of facilities with pollution linked to local health threats; 
to ensure the Environmental Protection Agency promul-
gates rules that require fenceline air monitoring in com-
munities with air polluting industrial source categories; 
to expand and strengthen the national ambient air qual-
ity monitoring network; to deploy air sensors in commu-
nities affected by air pollution, and for other purposes.
