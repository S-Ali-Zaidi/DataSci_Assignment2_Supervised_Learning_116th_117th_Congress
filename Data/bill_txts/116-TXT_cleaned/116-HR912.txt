RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of March 29, 2020,

Whereas the Vietnam war was fought in the Republic of Viet-
nam from 1955 to 1975 and involved regular forces from 
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Viet Cong guer-
rilla forces in armed conflict with the Armed Forces of 
the United States, the Armed Forces of allies of the 
United States, and the Armed Forces of the Republic of 
Vietnam; 
Whereas the Armed Forces of the United States became in-
volved in Vietnam because the United States Government

against the growing threat of communism from the 
Democratic Republic of Vietnam; 
Whereas members of the Armed Forces of the United States 
began serving in an advisory role to the Government of 
the Republic of Vietnam in 1955; 
Whereas, as a result of the incidents in the Gulf of Tonkin 
on August 2 and 4, 1964, Congress approved the Gulf of 
Tonkin Resolution (Public Law 88–408) by an over-
whelming majority on August 7, 1964, which provided to 
the President of the United States the authority to use 
armed force to assist the Republic of Vietnam in the de-
fense of its freedom against the Democratic Republic of 
Vietnam; 
Whereas, in 1965, ground combat units of the Armed Forces 
of the United States arrived in the Republic of Vietnam 
to join approximately 23,000 personnel of the Armed 
Forces who were already present there; 
Whereas, by September 1965, between 150,000 and 190,000 
troops of the Armed Forces of the United States were in 
Vietnam, and by 1969, the number of such troops 
reached a peak of approximately 549,500, including 
members of the Armed Forces who were supporting the 
combat operations from Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and 
aboard Navy vessels; 
Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Agreement on Ending 
the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Paris Peace Accords’’) was signed, which 
required the release of all prisoners-of-war of the United 
States held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of all 
Armed Forces of the United States from South Vietnam;

Whereas, on March 29, 1973, the Armed Forces of the 
United States completed the withdrawal of combat units 
and combat support units from South Vietnam; 
Whereas, on April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese regular forces 
captured Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, effectively 
placing South Vietnam under Communist control; 
Whereas more than 58,000 members of the Armed Forces of 
the United States lost their lives in the Vietnam war, and 
more than 300,000 members of the Armed Forces of the 
United States were wounded in Vietnam; 
Whereas, in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedi-
cated in the District of Columbia to commemorate the 
members of the Armed Forces of the United States who 
died or were declared missing in action in Vietnam; 
Whereas the Vietnam war was an extremely divisive issue 
among the people of the United States and a conflict that 
caused a generation of veterans to wait too long for the 
public of the United States to acknowledge and honor the 
efforts and services of those veterans; 
Whereas members of the Armed Forces who served bravely 
and faithfully for the United States during the Vietnam 
war were often wrongly criticized for the decisions of pol-
icymakers that were beyond the control of those mem-
bers; and 
Whereas designating March 29, 2020, as ‘‘Vietnam Veterans 
Day’’ would be an appropriate way to honor the members 
of the Armed Forces of the United States who served in 
South Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia during 
the Vietnam war: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
