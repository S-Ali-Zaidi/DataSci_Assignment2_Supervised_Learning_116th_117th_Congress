A BILL 
To authorize United States participation in the Coalition 
for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing America

Congress finds the following:

(1) Due to increasing population and popu-

change, emerging infectious diseases pose a real and 
1
growing threat to global health security. 
2
(2) While vaccines can be the most effective 
3
tools to protect against infectious disease, the ab-
4
sence of vaccines for a new or emerging infectious 
5
disease with epidemic potential is a major health se-
6
curity threat globally, posing catastrophic potential 
7
human and economic costs. 
8
(3) The 1918 influenza pandemic infected 
9
500,000,000 people, or about one-third of the 
10
world’s 
population 
at 
the 
time, 
and 
killed 
11
50,000,000 people—more than died in the First 
12
World War. 
13
(4) The economic cost of an outbreak can be 
14
devastating. The estimated global cost today, should 
15
an outbreak of the scale of the 1918 influenza pan-
16
demic strike, is 5 percent of global gross domestic 
17
product. 
18
(5) Even regional outbreaks can have enormous 
19
human costs and substantially disrupt the global 
20
economy and cripple regional economies. The 2014 
21
Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 
22
11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses in the af-
23
fected countries alone.

(6) The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak re-
1
flects the pressing need for quick and effective vac-
2
cine and countermeasure development. 
3
(7) While the need for vaccines to address 
4
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets to drive 
5
the necessary development of vaccines to address 
6
them—a complex and expensive undertaking—are 
7
very often critically absent. Also absent are mecha-
8
nisms to ensure access to those vaccines by those 
9
who need them when they need them. 
10
(8) To address this global vulnerability and the 
11
deficit of political commitment, institutional capac-
12
ity, and funding, in 2017, several countries and pri-
13
vate partners launched the Coalition for Epidemic 
14
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). CEPI’s mission 
15
is to stimulate, finance, and coordinate development 
16
of vaccines for high-priority, epidemic-potential 
17
threats in cases where traditional markets do not 
18
exist or cannot create sufficient demand. 
19
(9) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
20
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates through 
21
the end of phase II clinical trials, as well as support 
22
vaccine platforms that can be rapidly deployed 
23
against emerging pathogens.

(10) CEPI has funded multiple partners to de-
1
velop 
vaccine 
candidates 
against 
the 
novel 
2
coronavirus, responding to this urgent, global re-
3
quirement. 
4
(11) Support for and participation in CEPI is 
5
an important part of the United States own health 
6
security and biodefense and is in the national inter-
7
est, complementing the work of many Federal agen-
8
cies and providing significant value through global 
9
partnership and burden-sharing.
