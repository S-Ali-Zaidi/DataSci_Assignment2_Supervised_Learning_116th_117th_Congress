SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress makes the following findings: 
4
(1) Fathers play a significant and underappre-
5
ciated role in the development of their children, with 
6
research demonstrating that a supportive and in-
7
volved father strengthens a child’s emotional, phys-
8

ical, intellectual, and behavioral development. Chil-
1
dren with positive relationships with fathers, even if 
2
they do not live in the same household, have strong-
3
er mental health, economic success, and academic 
4
achievement with lower rates of youth delinquency, 
5
school dropout, and teen pregnancy. 
6
(2) Economic stability also leads to positive out-
7
comes for children, including stronger emotional 
8
well-being, physical health, and academic success. 
9
(3) Family patterns in the United States have 
10
resulted in fewer children living with their fathers. 
11
The October 2016 Child Trends report on family 
12
structure shows the proportion of all children who 
13
have not attained the age of 18 living with both par-
14
ents has decreased over the past half century, from 
15
85 percent in 1960 to 65 percent in 2015, with 23 
16
percent of such children living with their mother 
17
only and 4 percent of such children living with their 
18
father only in 2015. 
19
(4) A 2015 United States Census analysis of 
20
children’s living arrangements and characteristics 
21
showed that a child in a father-absent home is more 
22
than 5 times more likely to live in poverty than a 
23
child in a married-couple family.

•HR 3507 IH
(5) Father engagement does not depend on liv-
1
ing in the same house as the child, with many non-
2
residential fathers being actively involved with their 
3
children and supportive of their children’s mothers. 
4
However, low-income fathers experience multiple 
5
challenges to contributing financially and emotion-
6
ally to their children due to limited education and 
7
job skills, unstable employment opportunities, child 
8
support enforcement policies, incarceration, and 
9
strained relationships with the children’s mothers. 
10
Multiple approaches are needed to address these 
11
barriers to create opportunities for fathers to sustain 
12
their engagement and closeness with their children 
13
and families. 
14
(6) Federal programs should encourage respon-
15
sible fatherhood and healthy families by increasing 
16
the upward economic mobility of custodial and non-
17
custodial parents so that they can actively partici-
18
pate in financial support and child-rearing as well as 
19
maintain positive, healthy, and nonviolent relation-
20
ships with their children and coparents, including 
21
improving compliance with child support obligations 
22
and cooperative parenting.
