TITLE VI—PRIZE COMPETITION 
4
SEC. 601. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The rapidly growing use of warrant-proof 
7
encryption in everyday devices, platforms, and sys-
8
tems allows illegal actors engaged in dangerous 
9
criminal activity—including child sexual abuse, ter-
10
rorism, and international narcotics trafficking—to 
11
use encryption to shield their illicit activities from 
12
authorities. 
13
(2) Because of warrant-proof encryption, the 
14
government often cannot obtain the electronic evi-
15
dence and intelligence necessary to investigate and 
16
prosecute threats to public safety and national secu-
17
rity, even with a warrant or court order. This pro-
18
vides a ‘‘lawless space’’ that criminals, terrorists, 
19
and other bad actors can exploit for their nefarious 
20
ends. 
21
(3) Many service providers, device manufactur-
22
ers, and application developers who use encryption 
23
fail to implement technology that would allow the 
24
government to obtain electronic evidence necessary 
25
04:30 Aug 22, 2020
H7891
31 
•HR 7891 IH
to investigate and prosecute threats to public safety 
1
and national security. 
2
(4) The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution 
3
of the United States strikes a balance between the 
4
individual citizen’s reasonable expectation of privacy 
5
on one hand, and on the other, the legitimate need 
6
for the government to gain access to the most inti-
7
mate spaces in citizens’ lives in order to protect the 
8
public from criminal actors. 
9
(5) The Framers of the Constitution provided 
10
specific barriers to government intrusion into the in-
11
dividual’s private, intimate space—namely, that the 
12
government must show by probable cause that evi-
13
dence of a crime exists in that intimate space, and 
14
must have a neutral magistrate, detached from the 
15
law enforcement interest, approve law enforcement’s 
16
request and issue a warrant. 
17
(6) Once the government satisfies the burden of 
18
showing probable cause to a neutral magistrate, the 
19
government is entitled to search and seize evidence 
20
of a crime in an individual’s private space. 
21
(7) That careful balancing of interests estab-
22
lished by the Framers has continued to be calibrated 
23
throughout the history of the United States as dif-
24
ferent challenges have arisen, including, most nota-
25
04:30 Aug 22, 2020
H7891
32 
•HR 7891 IH
bly, technological advances in daily life. For exam-
1
ple, Congress has imposed additional statutory re-
2
quirements that the government must meet and that 
3
a judge must find satisfied before a court can au-
4
thorize interception of communications. But the in-
5
dividual’s right to privacy has never been absolute. 
6
(8) If not addressed, criminal anonymity actu-
7
ated by end-to-end encryption technology will con-
8
tinue to pose a serious risk to the public. 
9
(9) Nevertheless, advances in technology con-
10
tinue without due consideration of issues of lawful 
11
access. 
12
(10) Moreover, very little, if any, resources 
13
from the private sector or from educational and re-
14
search institutions are devoted to finding techno-
15
logical solutions to providing lawful access within 
16
different encrypted technological platforms. 
17
(11) More resources should be devoted to 
18
incentivizing the best minds in the United States to 
19
research the issues described in this section and de-
20
cide how to best provide the most secure products 
21
and services to customers while also providing law 
22
enforcement access to information the government 
23
needs to investigate criminals seeking to do the pub-
24
lic harm and to protect national security.
