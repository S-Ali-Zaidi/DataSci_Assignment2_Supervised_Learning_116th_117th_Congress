SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On December 19, 2019, the House of Rep-
3
resentatives passed two articles of impeachment 
4
against President Donald J. Trump for abuse of 
5
power and obstruction of Congress. 
6
(2) Numerous public servants provided testi-
7
mony to support the impeachment inquiry, including 
8
Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a decorated 
9
veteran who was on the call between President 
10
Trump and Ukraine President Volodymr Zelensky 
11
on July 25, 2019, which served as the basis for the 
12
impeachment inquiry. 
13
(3) Lieutenant Colonel Vindman served mul-
14
tiple tours of combat duty and was wounded during 
15
a tour in Iraq, for which he received a Purple Heart 
16
medal. 
17
(4) 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman, 
despite 
18
threats to his family and his career, testified to the 
19
following on October 28, 2019: 
20
(A) The July 25th call was ‘‘improper’’ 
21
and ‘‘unusual’’. 
22
(B) Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was con-
23
cerned by the call: ‘‘I did not think it was prop-
24
er to demand that a foreign government inves-
25
tigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about 
26

the implications for six of the U.S. Govern-
1
ment’s support of Ukraine. I realized that if 
2
Ukraine pursued an investigation into the 
3
Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be inter-
4
preted as a partisan play which would undoubt-
5
edly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan sup-
6
port it has thus far maintained. This would all 
7
undermine U.S. national security.’’. 
8
(5) Lieutenant Colonel Vindman further stated: 
9
‘‘Dad, I’m sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol 
10
talking to our elected professionals is proof that you 
11
made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the 
12
Soviet Union and come here to the United States of 
13
America in search of a better life for our family.’’, 
14
Vindman said: ‘‘Do not worry. I will be fine for tell-
15
ing the truth.’’. 
16
(6) Lieutenant Colonel Vindman faced unsub-
17
stantiated claims questioning his loyalty to the 
18
United States because he was born in Ukraine and 
19
other forms of retribution. 
20
(7) On February 7, 2019, Lieutenant Colonel 
21
Vindman was reassigned from his duties as Director 
22
for European Affairs at the National Security Coun-
23
cil. He was escorted from the White House by secu-
24
rity.

(8) President Trump stated on February 7, 
1
2019: ‘‘Well, I’m not happy with him [Vindman]. 
2
You think I’m supposed to be happy with him? I’m 
3
not.’’ He further accused Lieutenant Colonel 
4
Vindman of being ‘‘insubordinate’’ for testifying 
5
against the President truthfully.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

on the battlefield and in the impeachment inquiry by 
11
telling the truth; 
12
(2) faced retribution from the President of the 
13
United States as a result of his testimony in the im-
14
peachment inquiry; and 
15
(3) upholds the highest values of the United 
16
States and should be honored for his actions.
