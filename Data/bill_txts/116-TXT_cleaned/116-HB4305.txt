Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 4305 IH
(1) According to the analyses of veteran suicide 
1
published by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 
2
August 2016 and titled ‘‘Suicide Among Veterans 
3
and Other Americans’’, and in June 2018, titled 
4
‘‘VA National Suicide Date Report’’— 
5
(A) an average of 20 veterans died by sui-
6
cide each day in 2014; 
7
(B) mental health disorders, including 
8
major depression and other mood disorders, 
9
have been associated with increased risk for sui-
10
cide; 
11
(C) since 2001, the proportion of users of 
12
the Veterans Health Administration with men-
13
tal health conditions or substance use disorders 
14
has increased from approximately 27 percent in 
15
2001 to more than 40 percent in 2014; and 
16
(D) overall, suicide rates are highest 
17
among patients with mental health and sub-
18
stance use disorder diagnoses who are in treat-
19
ment and lower among those who received a 
20
mental health diagnosis but were not at risk 
21
enough to require enhanced care from a mental 
22
health provider. 
23
(2) The Department of Veterans Affairs must 
24
be more effective in its approach to reducing the 
25
01:12 Sep 13, 2019

•HR 4305 IH
burden of veteran suicide connected to mental health 
1
disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder 
2
(in this section referred to as ‘‘PTSD’’), and new, 
3
rigorous scientific research provides persuasive 
4
weight to the growing anecdotal evidence that serv-
5
ice dogs ameliorate the symptoms associated with 
6
PTSD, and in particular, help prevent veteran sui-
7
cide. 
8
(3) Several organizations have proven track 
9
records of training service dogs for veterans with se-
10
vere PTSD and dramatically improving those vet-
11
erans’ quality of life, ability to re-enter society, and, 
12
most importantly, their chances of survival.
