RESOLUTION 
Opposing the lifting of sanctions imposed with respect to 
Iran without addressing Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic 
missile development, support for terrorism, and other 
destabilizing activities. 
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), 
an agreement that was finalized by the administration of 
President Obama and the respective governments of the 
United Kingdom, Germany, France, the People’s Repub-
lic of China, and the Russian Federation (P5+1) in July 
2015, provided Iran permanent sanctions relief and ac-
cess to more than $100,000,000,000 in return for tem-
porary restrictive measures on Iran’s nuclear program;

•HRES 390 IH 
Whereas, under the JCPOA, restrictions on the number and 
types of centrifuges that Iran may manufacture, the 
number and types of enrichment facilities that Iran may 
construct, and the amount and level of enriched uranium 
and heavy water that Iran may stockpile, will expire; 
Whereas 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
(UNSCR) 2231, unanimously adopted on July 20, 2015, 
contained an 8-year nonbinding restriction on Iranian nu-
clear-capable ballistic missile activities and a 5-year ban 
on conventional arms transfers to Iran; 
Whereas neither the JCPOA nor UNSCR 2231 adequately 
addressed the threat emanating from Iran’s ballistic mis-
sile program or support for terrorism, and the sunset 
provisions applied to prohibitions in UNSCR 2231 inad-
vertently legitimized that program and support; 
Whereas, based on the shortcomings of the JCPOA and 
UNSCR 2231, bipartisan majorities in both the Senate 
and the House of Representatives opposed the JCPOA 
and the sanctions relief for Iran contained in the agree-
ment; 
Whereas the sanctions relief contained in the JCPOA pro-
vided resources necessary for Iran to continue developing 
ballistic missiles and supporting terrorism; 
Whereas the administration of President Trump has des-
ignated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
(IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization under section 
219(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1189(a)) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist 
group under Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701

actions with persons who commit, threaten to commit, or 
support terrorism); 
Whereas, on May 21, 2018, Secretary of State Pompeo out-
lined steps that the Iranian Government must take to 
normalize relations with the United States, to include— 
(1) providing the International Atomic Energy Agen-
cy (IAEA) a full account of the prior military dimensions 
of its nuclear program and permanently and verifiably 
abandoning such work; 
(2) ceasing all enrichment and vowing never to pur-
sue plutonium reprocessing; 
(3) providing the IAEA with access to all sites 
throughout the entire country; 
(4) ending its development and proliferation of bal-
listic missiles; 
(5) releasing all United States citizens currently held 
hostage, as well as citizens of United States partners and 
allies; 
(6) ending support for terrorist groups, including 
Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad; 
(7) respecting the sovereignty of Iraq by demobi-
lizing Iranian-controlled Shia militias in the country; 
(8) ending its military support for the Houthi militia 
in Yemen; 
(9) withdrawing all forces under Iranian command 
in Syria; 
(10) ending support for the Taliban in Afghanistan 
and for senior al Qaeda leaders around the region; 
(11) ending the IRGC’s support for terrorists and 
militant partners around the world; and 
(12) halting its threatening behavior against its 
neighbors;

•HRES 390 IH 
Whereas President Trump announced the withdrawal of the 
United States from the JCPOA on May 8, 2018, and, 
since then, has gradually reimposed sanctions that were 
suspended by the Obama Administration under the 
JCPOA; 
Whereas the JCPOA defined the sanctions that the Obama 
Administration suspended under the JCPOA as ‘‘nuclear- 
related’’, but ‘‘nuclear-related’’ is not a term recognized 
under existing statutory sanctions related to Iran; 
Whereas the Obama Administration agreed to define the 
most significant bilateral sanctions imposed by the 
United States on Iran as ‘‘nuclear-related’’, waive the ap-
plication of those sanctions under the JCPOA, and com-
mit the executive branch to attempt to work with Con-
gress and State and local governments in the United 
States to repeal the provisions of law providing for those 
sanctions upon the expiration of the JCPOA; 
Whereas, pursuant to the terms of the JCPOA, sanctions 
were lifted on Iranian financial institutions, cargo vessels, 
aircraft, and charities, which were not linked to Iran’s 
nuclear program but were sanctioned for illicit conduct; 
Whereas, pursuant to section 401(a) of the Comprehensive 
Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 
2010 (22 U.S.C. 8551(a)), in order to terminate sanc-
tions against the Central Bank of Iran and other finan-
cial institutions of Iran, the President is required to cer-
tify that ‘‘the Government of Iran has ceased providing 
support for acts of international terrorism and no longer 
satisfies the requirements for designation as a state spon-
sor of terrorism’’, and that ‘‘Iran has ceased the pursuit, 
acquisition, and development of, and verifiably disman-

tled its, nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and 
ballistic missiles and ballistic missile launch technology’’; 
Whereas, pursuant to section 8 of the Iran Sanctions Act of 
1996 (Public Law 104–172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note), in 
order to terminate sanctions imposed with respect to the 
energy sector of Iran, the President is required to certify 
‘‘that Iran— 
‘‘(1) has ceased its efforts to design, develop, manu-
facture, or acquire— 
‘‘(A) a nuclear explosive device or related mate-
rials and technology; 
‘‘(B) chemical and biological weapons; and 
‘‘(C) ballistic missiles and ballistic missile 
launch technology; 
‘‘(2) has been removed from the list of countries the 
governments of which have been determined . . . to have 
repeatedly provided support for acts of international ter-
rorism; and 
‘‘(3) poses no significant threat to United States na-
tional security, interests, or allies.’’; and 
Whereas the concept of ‘‘nuclear-related’’ sanctions does not 
exist in statute and existing statutes likely require a trea-
ty to terminate such sanctions: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) reaffirms that it is the policy of the United 
2
States not to allow Iran to develop or otherwise ac-

quire a nuclear weapons capability;

(2) resolves that the lifting or termination of

sanctions with respect to Iran must take place only
