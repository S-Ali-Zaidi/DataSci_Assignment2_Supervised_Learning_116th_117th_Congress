•HR 5390 IH
(1) The ocean and coastal waters of the United 
1
States are foundational to the economy, security, 
2
global competitiveness, and well-being of the United 
3
States and continuously serve the people of the 
4
United States and other countries as an important 
5
source of food, energy, economic productivity, recre-
6
ation, beauty, and enjoyment. 
7
(2) Over many years, the resource productivity 
8
and water quality of the ocean and coastal areas of 
9
the United States have been diminished by pollution, 
10
increasing population demands, economic develop-
11
ment, and natural and man-made hazard events, 
12
both acute and chronic. 
13
(3) Ocean and coastal areas of the United 
14
States are managed by State and Federal resource 
15
agencies and regulated on an interstate and regional 
16
scale by various overlapping Federal authorities, 
17
thereby creating a significant need for interstate co-
18
ordination to enhance regional priorities, including 
19
the ecological and economic health of those areas. 
20
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
21
gress that— 
22
(1) the United States should seek to support 
23
interstate coordination of shared regional priorities

relating to the management, conservation, resilience,

1
mize efficiencies through collaborative regional ef-
2
forts by Regional Ocean Partnerships, in consulta-
3
tion with Federal and State agencies, Tribal govern-
4
ments, and local authorities; and 
5
(2) such efforts would enhance existing and ef-
6
fective State coastal management efforts based on 
7
shared regional priorities. 
8
(c) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are as fol-
9
lows: 
10
(1) To complement and expand cooperative vol-
11
untary efforts intended to manage and restore ocean 
12
and coastal areas spanning across multiple State 
13
boundaries. 
14
(2) To expand Federal support for monitoring, 
15
data management, and restoration activities in ocean 
16
and coastal areas. 
17
(3) To commit the United States to a com-
18
prehensive cooperative program to achieve improved 
19
water quality in, and improvements in the produc-
20
tivity of living resources of, all coastal ecosystems. 
21
(4) To authorize Regional Ocean Partnerships 
22
as intergovernmental coordinators for shared inter-
23
state and regional priorities relating to the collabo-
24
rative management of the large marine ecosystems,

thereby reducing duplication of efforts and maxi-

mizing opportunities to leverage support in the 
2
ocean and coastal regions.

(5) To enable Regional Ocean Partnerships, or 
4
designated fiscal management entities of such part-
5
nerships, to receive Federal funding to conduct the 
6
scientific research, conservation and restoration ac-
7
tivities, and priority coordination on shared regional
