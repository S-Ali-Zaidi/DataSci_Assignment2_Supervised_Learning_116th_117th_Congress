RESOLUTION 
Expressing the support of the United States for the grass-
roots development programs the Inter-American Founda-
tion has undertaken for the past 50 years. 
Whereas the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) was created 
under section 401 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 
(22 U.S.C. 290f) ‘‘to achieve conditions in the Western 
Hemisphere under which the dignity and the worth of 
each human person will be respected and under which all 
men will be afforded the opportunity to develop their po-
tential, to seek through gainful and productive work the 
fulfillment of their aspirations for a better life, and to 
live in justice and peace’’;

Whereas the IAF invests in effective grassroots solutions that 
promote prosperity and peace and advance the growth of 
democratic institutions; 
Whereas the development model of the IAF, applied through 
more than 5,000 community-led grants, has empowered 
millions of marginalized and underserved people in the 
Americas to achieve dignified livelihoods, effective civil 
engagement, and safer, more peaceful, and more just 
communities; 
Whereas the IAF’s model— 
(1) has demonstrated that making direct grants to 
grassroots groups and civil society organizations in un-
derserved and vulnerable communities is cost effective; 
(2) fosters self-reliance by requiring grantees to mo-
bilize local resources for their own projects and by con-
necting them to networks of new partners; 
(3) leverages additional resources from private and 
community partners; and 
(4) incentivizes broad civic engagement and local 
ownership of community development; 
Whereas the IAF, by investing in grassroots initiatives that 
create businesses, jobs, and leadership opportunities in 
communities, reinforces the commitment of individuals to 
strengthening their own communities; 
Whereas rather than going through contractors or foreign 
governments, the IAF provides direct funding to civil so-
ciety organizations that support alternatives to migration, 
the drug trade, crime, unemployment, poverty, and exclu-
sion; 
Whereas the IAF addresses the root causes of migration from 
the Northern Triangle by supporting unique community-

led projects, such as the Organization for Youth Em-
powerment program in El Progreso, Honduras, a pro-
gram that supports 2,300 at-risk youth with technical 
training, team building, and microscholarships to com-
plete secondary school; 
Whereas the IAF has invested more than $5,000,000 since 
2017 in 45 projects focused on creating economic alter-
natives to coca production, building a resilient civil soci-
ety to contribute to a stable Colombia in the wake of the 
country’s peace agreement; 
Whereas listening and responding to the priorities of commu-
nities has allowed the IAF to foster trust and goodwill 
with the people of Latin America and the Caribbean; and 
Whereas the IAF’s ability to harness private sector and local 
resources, yielding a commitment of $1.31 in counterpart 
funds for every $1 invested by the IAF in the last 5 
years, effectively leverages foreign assistance resources 
and improves the sustainability of its investments: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) commends the Inter-American Foundation

for its exemplary contributions in promoting eco-
3
nomic and social development, democracy, and peace 
4
in Latin America and the Caribbean; 
5
(2) recognizes that the IAF’s unique, bottom-up

approach empowers individuals in marginalized and

underserved communities to be leaders, entre-

preneurs, innovators, and change makers in their

countries and communities;

(3) affirms the importance of the IAF, more
