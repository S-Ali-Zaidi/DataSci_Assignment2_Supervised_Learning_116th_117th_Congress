•HR 6270 IH
(1) Since early 2017, the Government of the 
1
People’s Republic of China has conducted a policy of 
2
disappearance, mass internment, and imprisonment 
3
of Turkic Muslims, particularly Uyghurs, in China’s 
4
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). 
5
(2) Since 2014, Chinese authorities have de-
6
tained between 800,000 and possibly up to three 
7
million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other 
8
ethnic minorities in forced education, training, and 
9
labor camps. 
10
(3) The bi-partisan, bi-cameral Congressional- 
11
Executive Commission on China’s 2019 Annual Re-
12
port found numerous reports of forced labor associ-
13
ated with government repression of ethnic minority 
14
groups in the XUAR. Detainees performed forced 
15
labor in factories both within and outside of intern-
16
ment camps in XUAR. 
17
(4) Radio Free Asia reported in January 2019 
18
that authorities had also sent Uyghurs and Kazakhs 
19
from the XUAR to other provinces in China for 
20
forced labor. 
21
(5) Comments in March 2018 from the presi-
22
dent of the China National Textile and Apparel 
23
Council suggested that textile manufacturers were

working with XUAR authorities to exploit forced 
1
labor. 
2
(6) Companies that work in the XUAR are at 
3
great risk of complicity in the human rights abuses 
4
being committed in the region. 
5
(7) In a March 2020 report, the Australian 
6
Strategic Policy Institute identified 27 factories in 
7
nine Chinese provinces that are using Uyghur labor 
8
transferred from Xinjiang. These factories indirectly 
9
supply global brands, including many American mul-
10
tinational companies. 
11
(8) Forced labor in XUAR is Chinese govern-
12
ment policy and due diligence efforts to ensure clean 
13
supply chains is nearly impossible due to mass sur-
14
veillance, pervasive police presence, and intimidation 
15
of workers. 
16
(9) The human rights policies, practices, and 
17
impacts of publicly traded companies in the United 
18
States are material to securities reporting. 
19
(10) An increasing percentage of investors con-
20
sider human rights risks as a part of their invest-
21
ment decision-making process.
