Congress finds the following:

•HR 5671 IH
(1) 2020 marked the 75th anniversary of Allied 
1
victory in World War II. 
2
(2) The United States Merchant Marine (in 
3
this section referred to as the ‘‘Merchant Marine’’) 
4
was integral in providing the link between domestic 
5
production and the fighting forces overseas, pro-
6
viding combat equipment, fuel, food, commodities, 
7
and raw materials to troops stationed abroad. 
8
(3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged 
9
the indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the 
10
victory in a 1945 letter stating that, without the 
11
support of the Merchant Marine, ‘‘the Navy could 
12
not have accomplished its mission’’. 
13
(4) President, and former Supreme Commander 
14
of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, Dwight D. Ei-
15
senhower acknowledged that ‘‘through the prompt 
16
delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed 
17
forces overseas, and of cargoes representing eco-
18
nomic and military aid to friendly nations, the 
19
American Merchant Marine has effectively helped to 
20
strengthen the forces of freedom throughout the 
21
world’’. 
22
(5) Military missions and war planning were 
23
contingent upon the availability of resources and the 
24
Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, 
25

•HR 5671 IH
ensuring the efficient and reliable transoceanic 
1
transport of military equipment and both military 
2
and civilian personnel. 
3
(6) The Merchant Marine provided for the suc-
4
cessful transport of resources and personnel despite 
5
consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combat-
6
ants from both the air and the sea, including from 
7
enemy bomber squadrons, submarines, and naval 
8
mines. 
9
(7) The efforts of the Merchant Marine were 
10
not without sacrifices as the Merchant Marine likely 
11
bore a higher per-capita casualty rate than any of 
12
the military branches during the war. 
13
(8) The Merchant Marine proved to be an in-
14
strumental asset on an untold number of occasions, 
15
participating in every landing operation by the 
16
United States Marine Corps, from Guadalcanal to 
17
Okinawa. 
18
(9) The Merchant Marine provided the bulk 
19
tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of 
20
Normandy, an invasion which, according to a 1944 
21
New York Times article, ‘‘would not have been pos-
22
sible without the Merchant Marine’’. 
23
(10) In assessing the performance of the Mer-
24
chant Marine, General Eisenhower stated, ‘‘every 
25

man in this Allied command is quick to express his 
1
admiration for the loyalty, courage, and fortitude of 
2
the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We 
3
count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion 
4
to duty as we do our own; they have never failed 
5
us’’. 
6
(11) During a September 1944 speech, Presi-
7
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt stated that the Merchant 
8
Marine had ‘‘delivered the goods when and where 
9
needed in every theater of operations and across 
10
every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and 
11
dangerous transportation job ever undertaken. As 
12
time goes on, there will be greater public under-
13
standing of our merchant fleet’s record during this 
14
war’’. 
15
(12) The feats and accomplishments of the 
16
Merchant Marine are deserving of broader public 
17
recognition. 
18
(13) The United States will be forever grateful 
19
and indebted to these merchant mariners for their 
20
effective, reliable, and courageous transport of goods 
21
and resources in enemy territory throughout thea-
22
ters of every variety in World War II. 
23
(14) The goods and resources transported by 
24
the Merchant Marine saved thousands of lives and 
25

•HR 5671 IH
enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World 
1
War II. 
2
(15) The Congressional Gold Medal would be 
3
an appropriate way to shed further light on the serv-
4
ice of the merchant mariners in World War II and 
5
the instrumental role they played in winning that 
6
war. 
7
(16) Many students of the Merchant Marine 
8
Academy lost their lives as they sailed through 
9
enemy-controlled waters or unloaded cargo in over-
10
seas combat areas, and, as a result, the United 
11
States Merchant Marine Academy is the only insti-
12
tution among the 5 Federal academies to be author-
13
ized to carry a battle standard as part of its color 
14
guard.
