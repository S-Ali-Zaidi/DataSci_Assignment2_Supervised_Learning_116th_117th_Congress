A BILL 
To protect a woman’s ability to determine whether and when 
to bear a child or end a pregnancy, and to protect 
a health care provider’s ability to provide reproductive 
health care services, including abortion services. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women’s Health Pro-
4
tection Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Access to safe, legal abortion services is es-
8
sential to women’s health and central to women’s 
9
ability to participate equally in the economic and so-
10
cial life of the United States.

(2) Since 1973, the Supreme Court repeatedly 
1
has recognized the constitutional right of a woman 
2
to decide to terminate her pregnancy before fetal vi-
3
ability, and to terminate her pregnancy after fetal 
4
viability where it is necessary, in the good-faith med-
5
ical judgment of the treating health care profes-
6
sional, for the preservation of her life or health. 
7
(3) Nonetheless, access to safe, legal abortion 
8
services has been hindered across the United States 
9
in various ways, including blockades of health care 
10
facilities and associated violence, prohibitions of and 
11
restrictions on insurance coverage, restrictions which 
12
shame and stigmatize women seeking abortion serv-
13
ices, and medically unnecessary regulations which 
14
neither confer any health benefit nor further the 
15
safety of abortion services, but which harm women 
16
by delaying access to, and reducing the availability 
17
of, services. Since 2010, States and local govern-
18
ments have passed more than 400 such restrictions 
19
singling out health care providers who offer abortion 
20
services and interfering with health care providers’ 
21
ability to provide reproductive health care services 
22
and the ability of patients to obtain those services. 
23
(4) Many State and local governments have im-
24
posed restrictions on the provision of abortion that 
25
03:29 Jun 07, 2019
H2975
4 
•HR 2975 IH
are neither evidence-based nor generally applicable 
1
to the medical profession or to other medically com-
2
parable outpatient gynecological procedures, such as 
3
endometrial ablations, dilation and curettage for rea-
4
sons other than abortion, hysteroscopies, loop 
5
electrosurgical excision procedures, or other analo-
6
gous non-gynecological procedures performed in 
7
similar outpatient settings including vasectomy, 
8
sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. 
9
(5) Legal abortion is one of the safest medical 
10
procedures in the United States. An independent re-
11
view of research on the safety and quality of abor-
12
tion services in the United States, published by the 
13
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
14
Medicine in 2018, found that abortion in all forms 
15
is safe and effective and that the biggest threats to 
16
the quality of abortion services in the United States 
17
are State regulations that create barriers to care. 
18
These abortion-specific restrictions conflict with 
19
medical standards and are not supported by the rec-
20
ommendations and guidelines issued by leading re-
21
productive health care professional organizations in-
22
cluding the American College of Obstetricians and 
23
Gynecologists, the Society of Family Planning, the 
24
03:29 Jun 07, 2019
H2975
5 
•HR 2975 IH
National Abortion Federation, the World Health Or-
1
ganization, and others. 
2
(6) Many abortion-specific restrictions do not 
3
confer any health or safety benefits on the patient. 
4
Instead, these restrictions have the purpose and ef-
5
fect of unduly burdening women’s personal and pri-
6
vate medical decisions to end their pregnancies by 
7
making access to abortion services more difficult, 
8
invasive, and costly, forcing women to travel signifi-
9
cant distances and make multiple unnecessary visits 
10
to the provider, and in some cases, foreclosing the 
11
option altogether. For example, a 2018 report from 
12
the University of California San Francisco’s Advanc-
13
ing New Standards in Reproductive Health research 
14
group found that in 27 cities across the United 
15
States, people have to travel more than 100 miles in 
16
any direction to reach an abortion provider. 
17
(7) These restrictions additionally harm wom-
18
en’s health by reducing access not only to abortion 
19
services but also to the other essential health care 
20
services offered by the providers targeted by the re-
21
strictions, including— 
22
(A) contraceptive services, which advance 
23
women’s health and provide a range of benefits, 
24
03:29 Jun 07, 2019
H2975
6 
•HR 2975 IH
including preventing unintended pregnancies 
1
and reducing the need for abortion; and 
2
(B) screenings for cervical cancer and sex-
3
ually transmitted infections. 
4
(8) The cumulative effect of these numerous re-
5
strictions has been to severely limit the availability 
6
of abortion services in some areas, creating a patch-
7
work system where access to abortion services is 
8
more available in some States than in others. A 
9
2019 report from the Government Accountability Of-
10
fice examining State Medicaid compliance with abor-
11
tion coverage requirements analyzed 7 key chal-
12
lenges (identified both by health care providers and 
13
research literature) and their effect on abortion ac-
14
cess, and found that access to abortion services var-
15
ied across the States and even within a State. 
16
(9) The harms of these abortion-specific restric-
17
tions fall especially heavily on low-income women, 
18
women of color, immigrants, young people, and 
19
women living in rural and other medically under-
20
served areas. 
21
(10) Abortion-specific restrictions single out 
22
health services used by women, and rely on and rein-
23
force stereotypes about women’s roles, women’s deci-
24
sionmaking, and women’s need for protection. These 
25
03:29 Jun 07, 2019
H2975
7 
•HR 2975 IH
restrictions harm the basic autonomy, dignity, equal-
1
ity, and ability of women to participate in the social 
2
and economic life of the Nation. 
3
(11) Not all people who become pregnant or 
4
need abortion services identify as women. Access to 
5
abortion services is critical to the health of every 
6
person regardless of actual or perceived race, color, 
7
national origin, immigration status, sex (including 
8
gender identity, sex stereotyping, or sexual orienta-
9
tion), age, or disability status. This Act’s protection 
10
is inclusive of all pregnant people. 
11
(12) These restrictions affect the cost and 
12
availability of abortion services, and the settings in 
13
which abortion services are delivered. Women travel 
14
across State lines and otherwise engage in interstate 
15
commerce to access this important medical care, and 
16
more would be forced to do so absent this Act. Like-
17
wise, health care providers travel across State lines 
18
and otherwise engage in interstate commerce in 
19
order to provide reproductive health services to pa-
20
tients, and more would be forced to do so absent this 
21
Act. 
22
(13) Health care providers, including those who 
23
provide abortion services, engage in a form of eco-
24
nomic and commercial activity when they provide 
25
03:29 Jun 07, 2019
H2975
8 
•HR 2975 IH
abortion services, and there is an interstate market 
1
for abortion services. 
2
(14) To provide abortion services, health care 
3
providers engage in interstate commerce to purchase 
4
medicine, medical equipment, and other necessary 
5
goods and services. To provide and assist others in 
6
providing abortion services, health care providers en-
7
gage in interstate commerce to obtain and provide 
8
training. To provide abortion services, health care 
9
providers employ and obtain commercial services 
10
from doctors, nurses, and other personnel who en-
11
gage in interstate commerce and travel across State 
12
lines. Abortion restrictions substantially affect inter-
13
state commerce in numerous ways. 
14
(15) It is difficult and time-consuming for clin-
15
ics to challenge State laws that burden or impede 
16
abortion services. Litigation that blocks one abortion 
17
restriction may not prevent a State from adopting 
18
other abortion restrictions or using different meth-
19
ods to burden or impede abortion services. There is 
20
a history and pattern of States passing successive 
21
and different laws that impede and unduly burden 
22
abortion services. 
23
(16) When a health care provider ceases pro-
24
viding abortion services as a result of burdensome 
25
03:29 Jun 07, 2019
H2975
9 
•HR 2975 IH
and medically unnecessary regulations, it is often 
1
difficult or impossible for that health care provider 
2
to recommence providing those abortion services, 
3
and difficult or impossible for other health care pro-
4
viders to provide abortion services that restore or re-
5
place the ceased abortion services. 
6
(17) An overwhelming majority of abortions in 
7
the United States are provided in clinics, not hos-
8
pitals. The large majority of United States counties 
9
have no clinics that provide abortion. 
10
(18) Congress has the authority to enact this 
11
Act to protect abortion services pursuant to— 
12
(A) its powers under the commerce clause 
13
of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of 
14
the United States; 
15
(B) its powers under section 5 of the Four-
16
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
17
United States to enforce the provisions of sec-
18
tion 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and 
19
(C) its powers under the necessary and 
20
proper clause of section 8 of Article I of the 
21
Constitution of the United States. 
22
(19) Congress has used its authority in the past 
23
to protect women’s ability to access abortion services 
24
and health care providers’ ability to provide abortion 
25
03:29 Jun 07, 2019
H2975
10 
•HR 2975 IH
services. In the early 1990s, protests and blockades 
1
at health care facilities where abortion services were 
2
provided, and associated violence, increased dramati-
3
cally and reached crisis level, requiring Congres-
4
sional action. Congress passed the Freedom of Ac-
5
cess to Clinic Entrances Act (Public Law 103–259; 
6
108 Stat. 694) to address that situation and protect 
7
physical access to abortion services. 
8
(20) Congressional action is necessary to put an 
9
end to harmful restrictions, to federally protect ac-
10
cess to abortion services for all women regardless of 
11
where they live, and to protect the ability of repro-
12
ductive health care providers to provide these serv-
13
ices in a safe and accessible manner. 
14
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act— 
15
(1) to permit health care providers to provide 
16
abortion services without limitations or requirements 
17
that single out the provision of abortion services for 
18
restrictions that are more burdensome than those re-
19
strictions imposed on medically comparable proce-
20
dures, do not significantly advance women’s health 
21
or the safety of abortion services, and make abortion 
22
services more difficult to access;

(2) to promote women’s health and women’s 
1
ability to participate equally in the economic and so-
2

3
(3) to invoke Congressional authority, including 
4
the powers of Congress under the commerce clause 
5
of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the 
6
United States, its powers under section 5 of the 
7
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
8
United States to enforce the provisions of section 1

of the Fourteenth Amendment, and its powers under 
10
the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of arti-
11

(6) A requirement or limitation concerning the 
1
physical plant, equipment, staffing, or hospital 
2
transfer arrangements of facilities where abortion 
3
services are provided, or the credentials or hospital 
4
privileges or status of personnel at such facilities, 
5
that is not imposed on facilities or the personnel of

provide abortion services. 
13
(8) A prohibition on abortion prior to fetal via-
14
bility, including a prohibition or restriction on a par-
15
ticular abortion procedure. 
16
(9) A prohibition on abortion after fetal viabil-

treating health care provider, continuation of the 
19
pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant pa-
20
tient’s life or health. 
21
(10) A limitation on a health care provider’s

perceived reasons for obtaining abortion services. 
8
(b) OTHER LIMITATIONS
OR REQUIREMENTS.—A 
9
health care provider has a statutory right to provide abor-
10
tion services, and may provide abortion services, and that

services, health care providers who provide 
19
abortion services, or facilities in which abortion 
20
services are provided; and

•HR 2975 IH
(c) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—Factors for a 
1
court to consider in determining whether a limitation or 
2
requirement impedes access to abortion services for pur-
3
poses of subsection (b)(2)(B) include the following: 
4
(1) Whether the limitation or requirement 
5
interferes with a health care provider’s ability to 
6
provide care and render services in accordance with 
7
the provider’s good-faith medical judgment. 
8
(2) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
9
reasonably likely to delay some patients in accessing 
10
abortion services. 
11
(3) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
12
reasonably likely to directly or indirectly increase the 
13
cost of providing abortion services or the cost for ob-
14
taining abortion services (including costs associated 
15
with travel, childcare, or time off work). 
16
(4) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
17
reasonably likely to have the effect of necessitating 
18
a trip to the offices of a health care provider that 
19
would not otherwise be required. 
20
(5) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
21
reasonably likely to result in a decrease in the avail-
22
ability of abortion services in a given State or geo-
23
graphic region. 
24
03:29 Jun 07, 2019
H2975
17 
•HR 2975 IH
(6) Whether the limitation or requirement im-
1
poses penalties that are not imposed on other health 
2
care providers for comparable conduct or failure to 
3
act, or that are more severe than penalties imposed 
4
on other health care providers for comparable con-
5
duct or failure to act. 
6
(7) The cumulative impact of the limitation or 
7
requirement combined with other new or existing 
8
limitations or requirements. 
9
(d) EXCEPTION.—To defend against a claim that a 
10
limitation or requirement violates a health care provider’s 
11
or patient’s statutory rights under subsection (b), a party 
12
must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that— 
13
(1) the limitation or requirement significantly 
14
advances the safety of abortion services or the health 
15
of patients; and 
16
(2) the safety of abortion services or the health
