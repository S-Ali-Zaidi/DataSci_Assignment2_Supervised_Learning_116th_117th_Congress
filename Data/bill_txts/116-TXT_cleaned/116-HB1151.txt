SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Chronic pain affects the veteran population, 
3
with almost 60 percent of veterans returning from 
4
serving in the Armed Forces in the Middle East, and 
5
more than 50 percent of older veterans, who are 
6
using the health care system of the Department of 
7
Veterans Affairs living with some form of chronic 
8
pain. 
9
(2) Opioids account for approximately 63 per-
10
cent of all drug deaths in the United States. 
11
(3) In 2011, veterans were twice as likely to die 
12
from accidental opioid overdoses as nonveterans. 
13
(4) States with medical cannabis laws have a 
14
24.8 percent lower mean annual opioid overdose 
15
mortality rate compared with States without medical 
16
cannabis laws. 
17
(5) Marijuana and its compounds show promise 
18
for treating a wide-range of diseases and disorders, 
19
including pain management. 
20
(6) Medical marijuana in States where it is 
21
legal may serve as a less harmful alternative to 
22
opioids in treating veterans.
