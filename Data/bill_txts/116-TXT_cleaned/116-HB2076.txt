A BILL 
To establish a demonstration program to explore effective 
practices to improve early detection and management 
of injuries indicative of potential abuse in infants under 
the age of 7 months, in order to prevent future cases 
of child abuse and related fatalities. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Early Detection to 
4
Stop Infant Abuse and Prevent Fatalities Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds as follows:

•HR 2076 IH
(1) According to the National Child Abuse and 
1
Neglect Data System, an estimated 1,720 children 
2
died from abuse or neglect in the United States in 
3
fiscal year 2017. Seventy-two percent of child fatali-
4
ties involved children younger than 3 years, and 50 
5
percent involved infants younger than 1 year. 
6
(2) According to the Commission to Eliminate 
7
Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities, infants and tod-
8
dlers are at high risk of an abuse or neglect fatality 
9
compared to other age groups and require special at-
10
tention. Because these young children are seen by 
11
health care professionals, the Commission rec-
12
ommended coordinated, cross-system approaches to 
13
prevention. 
14
(3) Multiple studies have found that relatively 
15
minor, visible injuries in young infants, including 
16
bruising and intraoral injuries, are often indicators 
17
of abuse. Such injuries are commonly overlooked by 
18
medical providers, caregivers, and child welfare pro-
19
fessionals because they seem trivial. Without early 
20
intervention, physical abuse can escalate, resulting 
21
in severe injuries or even fatalities. Many child 
22
abuse professionals refer to such injuries as ‘‘sen-
23
tinel injuries’’ in young infants because of their im-
24
portance as early warning signs of abuse. 
25

•HR 2076 IH
(4) Research conducted in Wisconsin showed 
1
that previous sentinel injuries were identified in 27.5 
2
percent of abused infants and 30 percent of infants 
3
who suffer abusive head trauma but were rare in in-
4
fants who had not been abused. Other studies have 
5
demonstrated similar rates of missed opportunities 
6
to identify abuse in young infants. 
7
(5) Proper identification of, and response to, 
8
such suspicious injuries provides an opportunity for 
9
early recognition and intervention to protect vulner-
10
able children and prevent many cases of abuse and 
11
related fatalities, as well as an opportunity to detect 
12
medical conditions that require urgent treatment. 
13
(6) Early detection of such injuries and effec-
14
tive evaluation and intervention requires education 
15
of caregivers of young infants, child protective work-
16
ers, and medical professionals about the significance 
17
of such injuries in young infants. 
18
(7) Best practices and protocols need to be de-
19
veloped to ensure an effective response by medical 
20
professionals, child protective services, and other 
21
professionals when sentinel injuries are detected.
