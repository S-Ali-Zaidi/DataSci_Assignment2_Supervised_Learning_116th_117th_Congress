9
financing for the buyer of that property and the 
10

buyer makes some form of a down payment to the 
1
seller and then makes installment payments to the 
2
seller over a defined period of time. 
3
(2) Seller financers provide financing in lieu of 
4
the buyer choosing to obtain a loan from a bank. 
5
(3) The seller finance industry consists of small 
6
business owners who own real estate and provide fi-
7
nancing on those properties to underserved bor-
8
rowers who cannot or would prefer not to obtain tra-
9
ditional financing. 
10
(4) It is recognized that seller financers are 
11
governed by each State’s particular real estate and 
12
consumer protection laws (including ability to repay, 
13
deceptive trade practices, and usury laws), as well as 
14
State and Federal fair housing and equal oppor-
15
tunity laws. 
16
(5) Neither of those laws described under para-
17
graph (4), nor the amendments made by this Act, 
18
are applicable to transactions known as contracts for 
19
deed, land installment contracts, lease options, op-
20
tions to buy, or rent-to-own agreements.
