phone operators of the Army Signal Corps, known as 
the ‘‘Hello Girls’’.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 1953 IH
(1) On April 6, 1917, the United States de-
1
clared war against Germany. As a historically neu-
2
tral nation, the United States was unprepared to 
3
fight a technologically modern conflict overseas. The 
4
United States called upon American Telephone and 
5
Telegraph (referred to in this section as ‘‘AT&T’’) 
6
to provide equipment and trained personnel for the 
7
Army Signal Corps in France. AT&T executives in 
8
Army uniform served at home under the provisions 
9
of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act for making further and 
10
more effectual provision for the national defense, 
11
and for other purposes.’’, approved June 3, 1916 
12
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘National Defense 
13
Act of 1916’’), which allowed for the induction of in-
14
dividuals with specialized skills into a reserve force. 
15
(2) When General John Pershing sailed for Eu-
16
rope in May of 1917 as head of the American Expe-
17
ditionary Forces (referred to in this section as the 
18
‘‘AEF’’), he took telephone operating equipment 
19
with him in recognition of the inadequacy of Euro-
20
pean circuitry and with the understanding that tele-
21
phones would play a key role in battlefield commu-
22
nications for the first time in the history of war. 
23
(3) From May to November of 1917, the AEF 
24
struggled to develop the telephone service necessary 
25

•HR 1953 IH
for the Army to function under battlefield condi-
1
tions. Monolingual infantrymen from the United 
2
States were unable to connect calls rapidly or com-
3
municate effectively with their French counterparts 
4
to put calls through over toll lines that linked one 
5
region of the country with another. The Army found 
6
that the average male operator required 60 seconds 
7
to make a connection. That rate was unacceptably 
8
slow, especially for operational calls between com-
9
mand outposts and the front lines. 
10
(4) During this time, in the United States, tele-
11
phone operating was largely sex-segregated. Hired 
12
for their speed in connecting calls, women filled 85 
13
percent of the telephone operating positions in the 
14
United States. It took the average female operator 
15
10 seconds to make a connection. 
16
(5) On November 8, 1917, General Pershing 
17
cabled the War Department and wrote, ‘‘On account 
18
of the great difficulty of obtaining properly qualified 
19
men, request organization and dispatch to France a 
20
force of Woman telephone operators all speaking 
21
French and English equally well.’’. To begin, Gen-
22
eral Pershing requested 100 women under the com-
23
mand of a commissioned captain, writing that ‘‘All 
24
00:27 Apr 11, 2019
H1953
4 
•HR 1953 IH
should have allowances of Army nurses and should 
1
be uniformed.’’. 
2
(6) The War Department sent press releases to 
3
newspapers across the United States to recruit 
4
women willing to serve for the duration of the war 
5
and face the hazards of submarine warfare and aer-
6
ial bombardment. These articles emphasized that pa-
7
triotic women would be ‘‘full-fledged soldier[s] under 
8
the articles of war’’ and would ‘‘do as much to help 
9
win the war as the men in khaki who go ‘over the 
10
top.’ ’’. All women would take the Army oath. 
11
(7) More than 7,600 women volunteered for the 
12
100 positions described in paragraph (5) and the 
13
first recruits took the Army oath on January 15, 
14
1918. 
15
(8) Like nurses and doctors at the time, female 
16
Signal Corps members had relative rather than tra-
17
ditional ranks and were ranked as Operator, Super-
18
visor, or Chief Operator. When promoted, the 
19
women were required to swear the Army oath again. 
20
(9) Telephone operators were the first women 
21
to serve as soldiers in non-medical classifications 
22
and the job of the operators was to help win the 
23
war, not to mitigate the harms of the war. In pop-
24
ular parlance, they were known as the ‘‘Hello Girls’’.

•HR 1953 IH
(10) Signal Corps Operators wore Army uni-
1
forms and Army insignia always, as well as stand-
2
ard-issue identity disks in case of death, and were 
3
subject to court martial for infractions of the mili-
4
tary code. 
5
(11) Unbeknownst to the women operators and 
6
their immediate officers, the legal counsel of the 
7
Army ruled internally on March 20, 1918, that the 
8
women were not actually soldiers but contract em-
9
ployees, even though the women had not seen or 
10
signed any contracts. Military code allowed only for 
11
the induction of men and the code remained un-
12
changed despite the orders of General Pershing. 
13
Nevertheless, legal counsel also recognized that the 
14
National Defense Act of 1916, which allowed for the 
15
induction of members of the telephone industry of 
16
the United States into the Armed Forces, imposed 
17
no gender restrictions. 
18
(12) Four days later, on March 24, 1918, the 
19
first contingent of operators began their official du-
20
ties in France. The operators arrived before most in-
21
fantrymen of the Armed Forces in order to facilitate 
22
logistics and deployment and spent their first night 
23
in Paris under German bombardment.

•HR 1953 IH
(13) After the arrival of the operators, tele-
1
phone service in France improved immediately, as 
2
calls tripled from 13,000 to 36,000 per day. 
3
(14) The Army quickly recruited, trained, and 
4
deployed 5 additional contingents of female Signal 
5
Corps operators. With these personnel, calls in-
6
creased to 150,000 per day. 
7
(15) In addition to standard telephone oper-
8
ating, bilingual Signal Corps members provided si-
9
multaneous translation between officers from France 
10
and officers from the United States, who were com-
11
municating by telephone. 
12
(16) The AEF fought their first major battles 
13
in the last 2 months of the war. By that point, the 
14
Signal Corps considered the contributions of women 
15
to be so essential that, in telephone exchanges clos-
16
est to the front line, the Army exclusively used 
17
women, in rotating 12-hour shifts. In the rear, the 
18
Army established rotating 8-hour shifts and gave 
19
male soldiers the overnight shift when telephone 
20
traffic was slower. 
21
(17) Seven bilingual operators— 
22
(A) served at the Battles of St. Mihiel and 
23
Meuse-Argonne under the immediate command 
24
of General Pershing; 
25
00:27 Apr 11, 2019

•HR 1953 IH
(B) staffed the Operations Boards through 
1
which orders to advance, fire, and retreat were 
2
delivered to soldiers in the trenches, to artillery 
3
units on alert, and to pilots awaiting orders at 
4
French airfields; and 
5
(C) were awarded a ‘‘Defensive Sector 
6
Clasp’’ for the Meuse-Argonne operation. 
7
(18) The Chief Operator supervising the Hello 
8
Girls, Grace Banker of Passaic, New Jersey, was 
9
awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Out of 
10
16,000 eligible Signal Corps officers, Banker was 1 
11
of only 18 individuals so honored. 
12
(19) Thirty additional operators received special 
13
commendations, many signed by General Pershing 
14
himself, for ‘‘exceptionally meritorious and con-
15
spicuous services’’ in ‘‘Advance Sections’’ of the con-
16
flict. 
17
(20) The war ended on November 11, 1918. As 
18
of that date, 223 female operators served in France 
19
and had connected 26,000,000 calls for the AEF. 
20
(21) The Chief Signal Officer of the Army Sig-
21
nal Corps wrote in his official report 2 days after 
22
the date on which the war ended that ‘‘a large part 
23
of the success of the communications of this Army 
24
00:27 Apr 11, 2019
H1953

•HR 1953 IH
is due to . . . a competent staff of women opera-
1
tors.’’. 
2
(22) After the war ended, some women were or-
3
dered to Coblenz in Germany for the occupation of 
4
that country and to Paris for the Paris Peace Trea-
5
ty of 1919 to continue telephone operations, some-
6
times in direct support of President Woodrow Wil-
7
son. 
8
(23) Two operators, Corah Bartlett and Inez 
9
Crittenden, died in France in the service of the 
10
United States and were buried there in military 
11
cemeteries with military ceremonies. Those operators 
12
died of the same influenza pandemic that killed more 
13
soldiers of the Armed Forces than combat oper-
14
ations. 
15
(24) Women of the Army Signal Corps were in-
16
eligible for discharge until formal release. Because of 
17
their role in logistics, those women were among the 
18
last soldiers to come home to the United States. The 
19
last Signal Corps operators returned from France in 
20
January of 1920. 
21
(25) Upon arrival in the United States, the 
22
Army informed female veterans that they had per-
23
formed as civilians, not soldiers, even though opera-
24
00:27 Apr 11, 2019

•HR 1953 IH
tors had served in Army uniform in a theatre of war 
1
surrounded by men who were similarly engaged. 
2
(26) Despite the objections of General George 
3
Squier, the top-ranking officer in the Signal Corps, 
4
the Army denied Signal Corps women the veterans’ 
5
benefits granted to male soldiers and female nurses, 
6
such as— 
7
(A) hospitalization for disabilities incurred 
8
in the line of duty; 
9
(B) cash bonuses; 
10
(C) soldiers’ pensions; 
11
(D) flags on their coffins; and 
12
(E) the Victory Medals promised them in 
13
France. 
14
(27) For the next 60 years, female veterans, led 
15
by Merle Egan from Montana, petitioned Congress 
16
more than 50 times for their recognition. In 1977, 
17
under the sponsorship of Senator Barry Goldwater, 
18
Congress passed legislation to retroactively acknowl-
19
edge the military service of the Women’s Air Force 
20
Service Pilots (referred to in this section as 
21
‘‘WASPs’’) of World War II and ‘‘the service of any 
22
person in any other similarly situated group the 
23
member of which rendered service to the Armed 
24
Forces of the United States in a capacity considered 
25
00:27 Apr 11, 2019
H1953
10 
•HR 1953 IH
civilian employment or contractual service at the 
1
time such service was rendered’’. 
2
(28) On November 23, 1977, President Jimmy 
3
Carter signed the legislation described in paragraph 
4
(27) into law as the GI Bill Improvement Act of 
5
1977 (Public Law 95–202; 91 Stat. 1433). 
6
(29) The Signal Corps telephone operators ap-
7
plied for, and were granted, status as veterans in 
8
1979. 
9
(30) Only 33 of the operators who had returned 
10
home after the war were still alive to receive their 
11
Victory Medals and official discharge papers, which 
12
were finally awarded in 1979. 
13
(31) One of the women, Olive Shaw from Mas-
14
sachusetts, returned to the United States after the 
15
war, where she worked on the professional staff of 
16
Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers. Shaw lived to 
17
receive her honorable discharge and was the first 
18
burial when the Massachusetts National Cemetery 
19
opened on October 11, 1980. Shaw’s uniform is on 
20
display at the National World War I Museum and 
21
Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. 
22
(32) Upon receipt of her honorable discharge at 
23
a ceremony in her home in Marine City, Michigan, 
24
‘‘Hello Girl’’ Oleda Joure Christides raised the paper 
25
00:27 Apr 11, 2019

•HR 1953 IH
to her lips and kissed it. The only thing Christides 
1
ever wanted from the Federal Government was a 
2
flag on her coffin. 
3
(33) On July 1, 2009, President Barack Obama 
4
signed into law Public Law 111–40 (123 Stat. 
5
1958), which awarded the WASPs the Congressional 
6
Gold Medal for their service to the United States. 
7
(34) For their role as pioneers who paved the 
8
way for all women in uniform, and for service that 
9
was essential to victory in World War I, the ‘‘Hello 
10
Girls’’ merit similar recognition.
