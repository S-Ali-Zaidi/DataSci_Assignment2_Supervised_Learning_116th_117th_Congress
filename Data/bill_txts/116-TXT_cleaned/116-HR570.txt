RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s Racial and Ethnic Ap-
proaches to Community Health (REACH) program. 
Whereas racial and ethnic minorities face strikingly high 
rates of racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease 
rates and other health and safety outcomes; 
Whereas, in September of 1999, Surgeon General David 
Satcher announced the first grants under the Racial and 
Ethnic Approaches to Community Health program, 
known as REACH, funding 32 community coalitions in 
18 States; 
Whereas REACH, created on the principle of community- 
based participatory approaches, has provided the most

impacted communities with the necessary resources and 
tools to address racial and ethnic disparities in chronic 
health conditions for the last 20 years; 
Whereas REACH has been the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention’s (CDC) cornerstone effort to directly 
fund community-based projects to address health dispari-
ties since 1999 and is today one of the only CDC pro-
grams specifically dedicated to addressing racial and eth-
nic health disparities in urban, rural, and Tribal commu-
nities; 
Whereas the REACH program’s model of robust community 
engagement and multisector representation in all aspects 
of program planning, development, and implementation 
has proved to be very successful in mobilizing efforts in 
communities with the greatest disease burden to address 
their health issues and priorities; 
Whereas REACH grantees have partnered with key stake-
holders in local communities to work on eliminating 
health disparities that leave so many Asian Americans, 
Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, African Ameri-
cans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and His-
panic Americans living sicker and dying younger than 
they should; and 
Whereas under the most recently concluded cohort of 
REACH grantees, funded from 2014 to 2018, 2,700,000 
people gained better access to healthy food and bev-
erages, 650,000 people benefited from tobacco-free inter-
ventions, 1,300,000 had increased opportunities to be 
physically active, and 750,000 people had better access to 
community-clinical linkages: Now, therefore, be it
