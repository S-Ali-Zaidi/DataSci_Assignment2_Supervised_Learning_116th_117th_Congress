•HR 2690 IH
(1) In recognition that trade policy can result 
1
in disparate and disruptive changes to the economy, 
2
the Trade Adjustment Assistance program was en-
3
acted to help workers adversely impacted by the 
4
trade policy decisions of the Federal Government. 
5
(2) The Trump Administration has made clear 
6
that it intends to aggressively use Federal trade 
7
statutes, including section 232 of the Trade Expan-
8
sion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1862), section 301 of 
9
the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411), and poten-
10
tially the International Emergency Economic Powers 
11
Act (Public Law 95–223), to increase tariffs on se-
12
lected imports. 
13
(3) Foreign countries affected by such tariff in-
14
creases have, as of the date of the enactment of this 
15
Act, already raised tariffs on United States agricul-
16
tural exports or have indicated that they intend to 
17
respond by raising tariffs on such agricultural ex-
18
ports. 
19
(4) Increased tariffs on such agricultural ex-
20
ports threaten to cost United States agricultural 
21
producers global market share and reduce the in-
22
come of producers of affected commodities. 
23
(5) Farmers adversely impacted by these effects 
24
deserve adjustment assistance.
