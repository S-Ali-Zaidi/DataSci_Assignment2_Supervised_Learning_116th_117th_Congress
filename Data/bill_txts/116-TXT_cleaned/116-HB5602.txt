SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Domestic Terrorism 
2
Prevention Act of 2020’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Recent reports have demonstrated that 
6
White supremacists and other far-right-wing extrem-
7
ists are the most significant domestic terrorism 
8
threat facing the United States, including— 
9
(A) a February 22, 2019, New York Times 
10
op-ed, by a Trump Administration United 
11
States Department of Justice official, who 
12
wrote that ‘‘white supremacy and far-right ex-
13
tremism are among the greatest domestic-secu-
14
rity threats facing the United States. Regret-
15
tably, over the past 25 years, law enforcement, 
16
at both the Federal and State levels, has been 
17
slow to respond. . . . Killings committed by in-
18
dividuals and groups associated with far-right 
19
extremist groups have risen significantly.’’; 
20
(B) an April 2017 Government Account-
21
ability Office report on the significant, lethal 
22
threat posed by domestic violent extremists, 
23
which— 
24
(i) explained that ‘‘[s]ince September 
25
12, 2001, the number of fatalities caused 
26
22:39 Jan 14, 2020
H5602
3 
•HR 5602 IH
by domestic violent extremists has ranged 
1
from 1 to 49 in a given year.’’; and 
2
(ii) noted that ‘‘[F]atalities resulting 
3
from attacks by far right wing violent ex-
4
tremists have exceeded those caused by 
5
radical Islamist violent extremists in 10 of 
6
the 15 years, and were the same in 3 of 
7
the years since September 12, 2001. Of 
8
the 85 violent extremist incidents that re-
9
sulted in death since September 12, 2001, 
10
far right wing violent extremist groups 
11
were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while 
12
radical Islamist violent extremists were re-
13
sponsible for 23 (27 percent).’’; and 
14
(C) an unclassified May 2017 joint intel-
15
ligence bulletin from the Federal Bureau of In-
16
vestigation and the Department of Homeland 
17
Security, which found that ‘‘white supremacist 
18
extremism poses [a] persistent threat of lethal 
19
violence,’’ and that White supremacists ‘‘were 
20
responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 
21
2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domes-
22
tic extremist movement’’. 
23

3
tack at a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey,

6
(3) In November 2019, the Federal Bureau of 
7
Investigation released its annual hate crime incident 
8
report, which found that in 2018, violent hate crimes 
9
reached a 16-year high. Though the overall number 
10
of hate crimes decreased slightly after three consecu-
11
tive years of increases, the report found a 4-percent 
12
increase in aggravated assaults, a 15-percent in-
13
crease in simple assaults, and a 13-percent increase 
14
in intimidation. There was also a nearly 6-percent 
15
increase in hate crimes directed at LGBTQ individ-
16
uals and a 14-percent increase in hate crimes di-
17
rected at Hispanic and Latino individuals. Nearly 60 
18
percent of the religion-based hate crimes reported 
19
targeted American Jews and Jewish institutions. 
20
The previous year’s report found that in 2017, hate 
21
crimes increased by approximately 17 percent, in-
22
cluding a 23-percent increase in religion-based hate 
23
crimes, an 18-percent increase in race-based crimes, 
24
and a 5-percent increase in crimes directed against 
25
22:39 Jan 14, 2020
H5602

•HR 5602 IH
LGBTQ individuals. The report analyzing 2016 data 
1
found that hate crimes increased by almost 5 per-
2
cent that year, including a 19-percent rise in hate 
3
crimes against American Muslims. Similarly, the re-
4
port analyzing 2015 data found that hate crimes in-
5
creased by 6 percent that year. Much of the 2015 
6
increase came from a 66-percent rise in attacks on 
7
American Muslims and a 9-percent rise in attacks 
8
on American Jews. In all 4 reports, race-based 
9
crimes were most numerous, and those crimes most 
10
often targeted African Americans. 
11
(4) On March 15, 2019, a White nationalist 
12
was arrested and charged with murder after alleg-
13
edly killing 50 Muslim worshippers and injuring 
14
more than 40 in a massacre at the Al Noor Mosque 
15
and Linwood Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. 
16
The alleged shooter posted a hate-filled, xenophobic 
17
manifesto that detailed his White nationalist ide-
18
ology before the massacre. Prime Minister Jacinda 
19
Ardern labeled the massacre a terrorist attack. 
20
(5) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist 
21
who had expressed anti-Muslim views was charged 
22
with murder for allegedly killing 6 people and injur-
23
ing 19 in a shooting rampage at a mosque in Quebec 
24
City, Canada. It was the first-ever mass shooting at 
25
22:39 Jan 14, 2020

9 
•HR 5602 IH
a mosque in North America, and Prime Minister 
1
Trudeau labeled it a terrorist attack. 
2
(6) On February 15, 2019, Federal authorities 
3
arrested U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher 
4
Paul Hasson, who was allegedly planning to kill a 
5
number of prominent journalists, professors, judges, 
6
and ‘‘leftists in general’’. In court filings, prosecu-
7
tors described Lieutenant Hasson as a ‘‘domestic 
8
terrorist’’ who in an email ‘‘identified himself as a 
9
White Nationalist for over 30 years and advocated 
10
for ‘focused violence’ in order to establish a white 
11
homeland.’’.
