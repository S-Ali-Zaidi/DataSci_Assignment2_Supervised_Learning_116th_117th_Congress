OF INTERREGIONAL TRANSMISSION PLAN-
2
NING. 
3
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 6 months after the 
4
date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Energy Regu-
5
latory Commission shall initiate a rulemaking to con-
6
sider— 
7
(1) the effectiveness of existing planning proc-
8
esses for identifying transmission projects across re-
9
gions that provide economic, reliability, operational, 
10
and public policy benefits, taking into consideration 
11
the public interest, the integrity of markets, and the 
12
protection of consumers; 
13
(2) changes to the processes described in para-
14
graph (1) to ensure that efficient, cost-effective, and 
15
broadly beneficial transmission solutions are selected 
16
for construction, taking into consideration— 
17
(A) the public interest; 
18
(B) the integrity of markets; 
19
(C) the protection of consumers; 
20
(D) the broad range of benefits that inter-
21
regional transmission provides; 
22

23

•HR 5511 IH
(F) that projects that meet interregional 
1
benefit criteria should not be subject to subse-
2
quent reassessment by regional entities; 
3
(G) the importance of synchronization of 
4
planning processes in neighboring regions, such 
5
as using a joint model on a consistent timeline 
6
with a single set of needs, input assumptions, 
7
and benefit metrics; 
8
(H) that evaluation of long-term scenarios 
9
should align with the expected life of a trans-
10
mission asset; 
11
(I) that transmission planning authorities 
12
should allow for the identification and joint 
13
evaluation of alternatives proposed by stake-
14
holders; 
15
(J) that interregional planning should be 
16
done regularly and not less frequently than 
17
once every 3 years; and 
18
(K) the elimination of arbitrary project 
19
voltage, size, or cost requirements for inter-
20
regional solutions; and 
21
(3) cost allocation methodologies that reflect 
22
the multiple benefits provided by interregional solu-
23
tions.
