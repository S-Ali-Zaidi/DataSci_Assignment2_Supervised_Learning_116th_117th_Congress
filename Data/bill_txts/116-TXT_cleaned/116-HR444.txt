RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming the importance of the United States to promote 
the safety, health, and well-being of refugees and dis-
placed persons. 
Whereas the United States has historically served as the 
benchmark for establishing a comprehensive response to 
displacement crises around the world, as well as for pro-
moting the safety, health, and well-being of refugees and 
displaced persons; 
Whereas June 20 is observed as World Refugee Day, a global 
day to acknowledge the courage, strength, resilience, and 
determination of women, men, and children who are

forced to flee their homes due to conflict, violence, and 
persecution; 
Whereas, in 2017, according to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees— 
(1) there were more than 68,500,000 displaced per-
sons worldwide, the worst displacement crisis in global 
history, including more than 25,400,000 refugees, over 
40,000,000 internally displaced persons, and 3,100,000 
people seeking asylum; 
(2) on average, 44,400 people were forced from their 
homes each day in the absence of peace and reconciliation 
in countries where armed conflict, violence, and persecu-
tion continue to reign; 
(3) 16,200,000 new individuals and families were 
displaced, the majority of whom were displaced within the 
borders of their own countries; 
(4) 60 percent of preventable maternal deaths occur 
in situations of conflict and displacement, and 1 in 5 ref-
ugees or displaced women in situations of humanitarian 
crisis suffer sexual violence, a figure which is likely un-
derestimated; 
(5) children accounted for 52 percent of all refugees, 
only half of them attend school; 
(6) refugee children were five times more likely to be 
out of school than children who are not displaced, with 
refugee girls having less access to school than refugee 
boys; 
(7) 68 percent of all refugees came from Syria, Af-
ghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar, and Somalia, includ-
ing 6,300,000 refugees from Syria alone; 
(8) there were more than 12,600,000 forcibly dis-
placed Syrians, including 6,300,000 refugees, 6,200,000

internally displaced people, and 146,700 asylum-seekers; 
and 
(9) 85 percent of all refugees were hosted by devel-
oping nations, and less than 1 percent of vulnerable refu-
gees in need of resettlement had the opportunity to reset-
tle because sufficient numbers of places do not exist; and 
Whereas the United States resettlement program is a life-sav-
ing solution critical to global humanitarian efforts, which 
serves to strengthen global security, advance United 
States foreign policy goals, and support regional host 
countries while serving individuals and families in need: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of the 
2
United States to promote the safety, health, edu-
3
cation, and well-being of the millions of refugees and 
4
displaced persons uprooted by war, persecution, and 
5
violence in search of peace, hope, and freedom; 
6
(2) supports those who have risked their lives, 
7

8
organizations or international agencies such as the 
9

11
displaced around the world;

(3) underscores the importance of the United 
13
States refugee resettlement program as a critical 
14
tool for United States global leadership to leverage
