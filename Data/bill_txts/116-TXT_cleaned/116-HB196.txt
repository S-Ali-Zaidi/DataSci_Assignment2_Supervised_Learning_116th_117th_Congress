To secure the Federal voting rights of persons when released 
from incarceration. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Democracy Restoration

Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The right to vote is the most basic constitu-
3
tive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to vote 
4
reintegrates individuals with criminal convictions 
5
into free society, helping to enhance public safety. 
6
(2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution 
7
grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over 
8
Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly 
9
been upheld by the United States Supreme Court. 
10
(3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness 
11
and equal protection require an equal opportunity 
12
for citizens of the United States to vote in Federal 
13
elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or 
14
denied by the United States or by any State on ac-
15
count of race, color, gender, or previous condition of 
16
servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 
17
26th Amendments to the Constitution empower Con-
18
gress to enact measures to protect the right to vote 
19
in Federal elections. The 8th Amendment to the 
20
Constitution provides for no excessive bail to be re-
21
quired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and 
22
unusual punishments inflicted. 
23
(4) There are 3 areas in which discrepancies in 
24
State laws regarding criminal convictions lead to un-
25
fairness in Federal elections— 
26
19:16 Jan 16, 2019
H196
3 
•HR 196 IH
(A) the lack of a uniform standard for vot-
1
ing in Federal elections leads to an unfair dis-
2
parity and unequal participation in Federal 
3
elections based solely on where a person lives; 
4
(B) laws governing the restoration of vot-
5
ing rights after a criminal conviction vary 
6
throughout the country and persons in some 
7
States can easily regain their voting rights 
8
while in other States persons effectively lose 
9
their right to vote permanently; and 
10
(C) State disenfranchisement laws dis-
11
proportionately impact racial and ethnic minori-
12
ties. 
13
(5) Two States do not disenfranchise individ-
14
uals with criminal convictions at all (Maine and 
15
Vermont), but 48 States and the District of Colum-
16
bia have laws that deny convicted individuals the 
17
right to vote while they are in prison. 
18
(6) In some States disenfranchisement results 
19
from varying State laws that restrict voting while in-
20
dividuals are under the supervision of the criminal 
21
justice system or after they have completed a crimi-
22
nal sentence. In 33 States, convicted individuals may 
23
not vote while they are on parole and 29 of those 
24
States disenfranchise individuals on felony probation 
25

as well. In 11 States, a conviction can result in life-
1
time disenfranchisement. 
2
(7) Several States deny the right to vote to in-
3
dividuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. 
4
(8) An estimated 6,100,000 citizens of the 
5
United States, or about 1 in 40 adults in the United 
6
States, currently cannot vote as a result of a felony 
7
conviction. Of the 6,100,000 citizens barred from 
8
voting, only 23 percent are in prison. By contrast, 
9
77 percent of the disenfranchised reside in their 
10
communities while on probation or parole or after 
11
having completed their sentences. Approximately 
12
3,100,000 citizens who have completed their sen-
13
tences remain disenfranchised due to restrictive 
14
State laws. In at least 6 States—Alabama, Florida, 
15
Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia— 
16
more than 7 percent of the total population is 
17
disenfranchised. 
18
(9) In those States that disenfranchise individ-
19
uals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained 
20
in theory, but in practice this possibility is often 
21
granted in a non-uniform and potentially discrimina-
22
tory manner. Disenfranchised individuals must ei-
23
ther obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor 
24
or an action by the parole or pardon board, depend-
25

ing on the offense and State. Individuals convicted 
1
of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to 
2
regaining voting rights. 
3
(10) State disenfranchisement laws dispropor-
4
tionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. More 
5
than 7 percent of the African-American population, 
6
or 
2,200,000 
African-Americans, 
are 
7
disenfranchised. Currently, 1 of every 13 African- 
8
Americans are rendered unable to vote because of 
9
felony disenfranchisement, which is a rate more than 
10
4 times greater than non African-Americans. Over 7 
11
percent 
of 
African-American 
adults 
are 
12
disenfranchised whereas only 1.8 percent of non Af-
13
rican-Americans are. In 4 States (Kentucky, 26 per-
14
cent; Virginia, 22 percent; Florida, 21 percent; and 
15
Tennessee, 21 percent), more than 1 in 5 African- 
16
Americans are unable to vote because of prior con-
17
victions. 
18
(11) Latino citizens are disproportionately 
19
disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate 
20
representation in the criminal justice system. If cur-
21
rent incarceration trends hold, 17 percent of Latino 
22
men will be incarcerated during their lifetimes, in 
23
contrast to less than 6 percent of non-Latino White 
24
men. When analyzing the data across 10 States, 
25
19:16 Jan 16, 2019
H196
6 
•HR 196 IH
Latinos generally have disproportionately higher 
1
rates of disenfranchisement compared to their pres-
2
ence in the voting age population. In 6 out of 10 
3
States studied in 2003, Latinos constitute more 
4
than 10 percent of the total number of persons 
5
disenfranchised by State felony laws. In 4 States 
6
(California, 37 percent; New York, 34 percent; 
7
Texas, 30 percent; and Arizona, 27 percent), 
8
Latinos were disenfranchised by a rate of more than 
9
25 percent. 
10
(12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been 
11
convicted of a criminal offense and who are living 
12
and working in the community serves no compelling 
13
State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and 
14
reintegration into society. 
15
(13) State disenfranchisement laws can sup-
16
press electoral participation among eligible voters by 
17
discouraging voting among family and community 
18
members of disenfranchised persons. Future elec-
19
toral participation by the children of disenfranchised 
20
parents may be impacted as well. 
21
(14) The United States is the only Western de-
22
mocracy that permits the permanent denial of voting 
23
rights for individuals with felony convictions.
