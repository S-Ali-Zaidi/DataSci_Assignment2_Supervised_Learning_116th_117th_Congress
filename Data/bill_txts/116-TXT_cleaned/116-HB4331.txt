(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
11
(1) Tibetan Buddhism is practiced in many 
12
countries including the People’s Republic of China, 
13
Bhutan, Nepal, Mongolia, India, the Russian Fed-
14
eration, and the United States. 
15
(2) No single political entity encompasses the 
16
territory in which Tibetan Buddhism is practiced. 
17
(3) The Dalai Lama is widely revered by Ti-
18
betan Buddhists and those who practice Tibetan 
19
Buddhism around the world, including those in the 
20
United States, as their spiritual leader. 
21
(4) Under the Tibetan Buddhist belief system, 
22
there have been 14 persons recognized as the Dalai 
23
Lama, each a manifestation of the Bodhisattva of 
24
Compassion, selected according to the spiritual tra-
25
ditions and practices of Tibetan Buddhism.

(5) The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, 
1
issued a statement on September 24, 2011, explain-
2
ing the traditions and spiritual precepts of the selec-
3
tion of Dalai Lamas, setting forth his views on the 
4
considerations and process for selecting his suc-
5
cessor, and providing a response to the Chinese gov-
6
ernment’s claims that only the Chinese government 
7
has the ultimate authority in the selection process of 
8
the Dalai Lama. 
9
(6) The 14th Dalai Lama said in his statement 
10
that if a decision to continue the institution of the 
11
Dalai Lama is made, that the responsibility shall 
12
primarily rest with the Dalai Lama’s Gaden 
13
Phodrang Trust, who will be informed by the written 
14
instructions of the 14th Dalai Lama. 
15
(7) Since 2011, the 14th Dalai Lama has reit-
16
erated publicly on numerous occasions that decisions 
17
on the succession or reincarnation of the next Dalai 
18
Lama belongs to the Tibetan Buddhist faith commu-
19
nity alone. 
20
(8) The Government of the People’s Republic of 
21
China has interfered in the process of recognizing a 
22
successor or reincarnation of Tibetan Buddhist lead-
23
ers, including in 1995 by arbitrarily detaining

identified as the 11th Panchen Lama, and pur-
1
porting to install its own candidate as the Panchen 
2
Lama. 
3
(9) During his confirmation hearings to be Sec-
4
retary of State, Michael Pompeo testified to the Sen-
5
ate Foreign Relations Committee that ‘‘If confirmed, 
6
I will press the Chinese government to respect the 
7
legitimacy of Tibetan Buddhists’ religious practices. 
8
This includes the decisions of Tibetan Buddhists in 
9
selecting, educating, and venerating the lamas who 
10
lead the faith, such as the Dalai Lama.’’. 
11
(10) The Department of State’s Report on 
12
International Religious Freedom for 2017 reported 
13
on policies and efforts of the Government of the 
14
People’s Republic of China to exert control over the 
15
selection of Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders, in-
16
cluding reincarnate lamas, and stated that ‘‘U.S. of-
17
ficials underscored that decisions on the reincarna-
18
tion of the Dalai Lama should be made solely by 
19
faith leaders.’’. 
20
(11) In July 2015, Under Secretary of State 
21
for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human 
22
Rights, Sarah Sewall, serving concurrently as United 
23
States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, testi-
24
fied to Congress that ‘‘the basic and universally rec-

ognized right of religious freedom demands that any 
1
decision on the next Dalai Lama be reserved to the 
2
current Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders, and 
3
the Tibetan people’’. 
4
(12) On June 8, 2015, the United States 
5
House of Representatives unanimously approved 
6
House Resolution 337 which calls on the United 
7
States Government to ‘‘underscore that government 
8
interference in the Tibetan reincarnation process is 
9
a violation of the internationally recognized right to 
10
religious freedom, and that matters related to rein-
11
carnations in Tibetan Buddhism are of keen interest 
12
to Tibetan Buddhist populations worldwide’’. 
13
(13) On April 25, 2018, the United States Sen-
14
ate unanimously approved Senate Resolution 429 
15
which ‘‘expresses its sense that the identification 
16
and installation of Tibetan Buddhist religious lead-
17

18
that should be determined solely within the Tibetan 
19
Buddhist faith community, in accordance with the 
20
inalienable right to religious freedom’’.

(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
22
United States that—

3
dhist tradition and in the context of the will of reli-
4
gious practitioners and the instructions of the 14th 
5
Dalai Lama; and 
6
(2) interference by the Government of the Peo-
7
ple’s Republic of China or any other government in 
8
the process of recognizing a successor or reincarna-
9
tion of the Dalai Lama would represent a clear vio-
10
lation of the fundamental religious freedoms of Ti-
11

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

(1) Glaciers in Tibet feed ten of the major riv-
21
ers of South and East Asia, which supply freshwater 
22
to an estimated 1.8 billion people. 
23

•HR 4331 IH
ture has increased at twice the global average, caus-
1
ing melting of the glaciers, which will result in vari-
2
able water flows in the future. 
3
(3) Tibet’s rivers support wetlands that play a 
4
key role in water storage, water quality, and the reg-
5
ulation of water flow, and support biodiversity, fos-
6
ter vegetation growth, and act as carbon sinks. 
7
(4) The grasslands of Tibet play a significant 
8
role in carbon production and sequestration. 
9
(5) Changes in permafrost levels, caused by ris-
10
ing temperatures and intensifying evaporation, can 
11
affect the water supply, cause desertification, and 
12
destabilize infrastructure on the Tibetan Plateau 
13
and beyond. 
14
(6) The warming of the Tibetan plateau may 
15
cause changes in the monsoon cycle in South and 
16
Southeast Asia, which could lead to droughts or 
17
floods that overwhelm infrastructure and damage 
18
crops. 
19
(7) The resettlement of nomads from Tibetan 
20
grasslands undermines the application of traditional 
21
stewardship practices developed though centuries of 
22
pastoral practices, which can be key to mitigating 
23
the negative effects of warming on the Tibetan Pla-
24

SEC. 6. DEMOCRACY IN THE TIBETAN EXILE COMMUNITY. 
11
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
12
(1) The 14th Dalai Lama has overseen a proc-
13
ess of democratization within the Tibetan polity, be-
14
ginning in Tibet in the 1950s and continuing in exile 
15
from the 1960s to the present. 
16
(2) The first representative body in Tibetan his-
17
tory, formed on September 2, 1960, was the pre-
18
cursor of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile, the legis-
19
lative branch within the Central Tibetan Administra-
20
tion. 
21
(3) The first direct election for the chief execu-
22
tive of the Central Tibetan Administration was held 
23
on July 29, 2001, with the election of Professor 
24
Samdhong Rinpoche.

(4) On March 10, 2011, the 14th Dalai Lama 
1
announced that he would relinquish his political re-
2
sponsibilities and on August 8, 2011, he transferred 
3
full political power to the elected leadership of the 
4
Central Tibetan Administration. 
5
(5) On March 20, 2011, members of the Ti-
6
betan exile community across some 30 countries held 
7
elections, monitored by international observers and 
8
assessed to be free and fair, to select the next par-
9
liament and chief executive. 
10
(6) As a result of the codification of the trans-
11
fer of political power from the Dalai Lama, the 
12
Kalon Tripa, or Chief of the Cabinet, assumed full 
13
executive authority and the Tibetan Parliament in 
14
Exile assumed full legislative authority within the 
15
Central Tibetan Administration. 
16
(7) As a result of the 2011 elections, the 15th 
17
Tibetan Parliament was seated and Lobsang Sangay 
18
was chosen as Kalon Tripa, a title changed to 
19
Sikyong in 2012. 
20
(8) Approximately six million Tibetans in Tibet 
21
do not enjoy a democratic form of government or the 
22
ability to elect their political representatives.

pressed the sense of Congress that Tibet’s true rep-
1
resentatives are the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan 
2
government-in-exile as recognized by the Tibetan 
3
people and that Tibet has maintained throughout its 
4
history a distinctive and sovereign national, cultural, 
5
and religious identity separate from that of China 
6
and, except during periods of illegal Chinese occupa-
7
tion, has maintained a separate and sovereign polit-
8
ical and territorial identity.

(10) The Middle Way Approach, the official 
10
policy of the Central Tibetan Administration, seeks 
11
genuine autonomy for the six million Tibetans in 
12
Tibet.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
14
gress that— 
15
(1) Tibetan exile communities around the world 
16
should be commended for the successful adoption of 
17
a system of self governance with democratic institu-
18
tions and free elections to choose their leaders; 
19
(2) the Dalai Lama should be commended for 
20
his decision to transfer political authority to elected 
21
leaders in accordance with democratic principles; 
22

23

(4) as consistent with section 621(d)(3) of the 
3
Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 6901 note), 
4
the United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan 
5
Issues should continue to maintain close contact 
6
with the religious, cultural, and elected leaders of 
7
the Tibetan people; and 
8
(5) the adoption of democracy within the Ti-

SEC. 7. SUSTAINABILITY IN TIBETAN COMMUNITIES SEEK-
13
ING TO PRESERVE THEIR CULTURE, RELI-
14
GION, AND LANGUAGE. 
15
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
16
(1) Following the flight into exile of the Dalai 
17
Lama and tens of thousands of fellow Tibetans, the 
18
Government of India graciously granted land on 
19
which the Tibetan refugees could settle. 
20
(2) Under the leadership of the Dalai Lama, 
21
Tibetan refugees established in settlements in India, 
22
Nepal, and Bhutan monastic, cultural, and edu-
23

their religion, culture, and language until the time 
1
that they could return to Tibet. 
2
(3) Many of the Tibetan settlements are more 
3
than 50 years old with aging infrastructure, chal-
4
lenging the capacity to absorb new refugees and pro-
5
vide modern services and gainful employment. 
6
(4) The threats to Tibetan culture, religion, and 
7
language in the People’s Republic of China justify 
8
support for efforts by Tibetans outside China to pre-
9
serve their heritage. 
10
(5) Many long-staying Tibetans in Nepal have 
11
not received documentation that would provide legal 
12
resident status and allow them fuller access to edu-
13
cational opportunities and sustainable participation 
14
in the economy and society of Nepal. 
15
(6) It is United States policy to promote the 
16
human rights of the Tibetan people and the preser-
17
vation of the distinct Tibetan cultural, religious, and 
18
linguistic heritage. 
19
(7) The Dalai Lama has said that the Central 
20
Tibetan Administration will cease to exist once a ne-
21
gotiated settlement has been achieved that allows Ti-
22
betans to freely enjoy their culture, religion, and lan-
23
guage in Tibet.
