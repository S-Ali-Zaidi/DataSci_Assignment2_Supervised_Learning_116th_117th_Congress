Congress, the United States retains many advan-
1
tages over the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 
2
space, including— 
3
(A) the organization and technical exper-
4
tise of its space program; 
5
(B) NASA’s national capabilities for 
6
human spaceflight and exploration; 
7
(C) its vibrant commercial space sector; 
8
(D) its long history of space leadership; 
9
and 
10
(E) many international partnerships. 
11
(2) The PRC seeks to establish a leading posi-
12
tion in the economic and military use of outer space 
13
and views space as critical to its future security and 
14
economic interests. 
15
(3) The PRC’s national-level commitment to es-
16
tablishing itself as a global space leader harms 
17
United States interests and threatens to undermine 
18
many of the advantages the United States has 
19
worked so long to establish. 
20
(4) For over 60 years, the United States has 
21
led the world in space exploration and human space 
22
flight through a robust national program that en-
23
sures 
NASA 
develops 
and 
maintains 
critical 
24
spaceflight systems to enable this leadership, includ-

ing the Apollo program’s Saturn V rocket, the Space 
1
Shuttle, the International Space Station and the 
2
Space Launch System and Orion today.

(5) A 2019 Defense Intelligence Agency noted 
4
in its ‘‘Challenges to U.S. Security in Space’’ report 
5
that the PRC was developing a national super-heavy 
6
lift rocket comparable to NASA’s Space Launch 
7
System. 
8
(6) The United States space program and com-
9
mercial space sector risks being hollowed out by the 
10
PRC’s plans to attain leadership in key technologies. 
11
(7) It is in the economic and security interest 
12
of the United States to remain the global leader in 
13
space power. 
14
(8) A recent report by the Air Force Research 
15
Laboratory and the Defense Innovation Unit found 
16
that China’s strategy to bolster its domestic space 
17
industry includes a global program of theft and 
18
other misappropriation of intellectual property, di-
19
rect integration of state-owned entities and their 
20
technology with commercial start-ups, the use of 
21
front companies to invest in United States space 
22
companies, vertical control of supply chains, and 
23
predatory pricing.
