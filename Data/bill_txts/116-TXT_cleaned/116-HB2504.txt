Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Willie O’Ree Congres-
4
sional Gold Medal Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Willie O’Ree was the first Black player to 
8
compete in the National Hockey League (NHL), ap-
9
pearing for the Boston Bruins on January 18, 1958, 
10
in the throes of the civil rights movement in the 
11
United States helping to end racial segregation in 
12
the premier professional ice hockey league; he is 
13
widely referred to as the ‘‘Jackie Robinson of Hock-
14
ey’’. 
15
(2) Willie O’Ree was born October 15, 1935, in 
16
Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada; he is the 
17
youngest of 13 children and a descendant of Paris 
18
O’Ree, whose name appears in the famous historical 
19
document ‘‘The Book of Negroes’’. 
20
(3) Willie O’Ree was raised by his parents in 
21
Fredericton, a predominantly White town where 
22
hockey was deeply rooted within the culture. O’Ree 
23
was a standout athlete on the ice and the baseball 
24
diamond.

(4) At age 21, O’Ree was being scouted by pro-
1
fessional baseball teams and seriously considered 
2
baseball as a career. Upon experiencing the seg-
3
regated South for the first time while appearing for 
4
a minor league tryout, his dream changed and his 
5
attention turned solely to ice hockey. 
6
(5) While playing amateur hockey, Willie was 
7
struck in his right eye with a puck and lost his eye-
8
sight. He was told by doctors to abandon his hockey 
9
career; instead, never disclosing the extent of his in-
10
jury, he pursued his dream of playing professional 
11
hockey. 
12
(6) At the age of 22, O’Ree was called up from 
13
the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Hockey League 
14
(QHL) to play for the NHL’s Boston Bruins at a 
15
time when only 6 teams existed in the league. O’Ree 
16
was unaware he had broken the color barrier at the 
17
top level of the sport until he read it in the news-
18
paper the following day. 
19
(7) Blind in 1 eye and a victim of racism at 
20
times throughout his career, O’Ree persevered and 
21
played professional hockey for 22 years, tallying over 
22
1,000 points. 
23
(8) In 1996, 17 years after O’Ree retired from 
24
professional hockey, the National Hockey League

hired O’Ree as the first-ever Diversity Ambassador. 
1
Having already changed the game forever through 
2
his courage and convictions, O’Ree gives new defini-
3
tion to what it means to be a trailblazer. 
4
(9) In this role as Diversity Ambassador with 
5
the NHL, O’Ree set out to grow the sport by pro-
6
viding access, opportunity, and motivation for chil-
7
dren of all races, ethnicities, origins, and abilities. 
8
With O’Ree providing a vivid example of what is 
9
possible and serving as a relentless supporter of chil-
10
dren pursuing their dreams, more than 30 nonprofit 
11
youth organizations, dubbed Hockey is for Everyone 
12
programs, were developed across North America, 
13
each committed to offering minority and under-
14
served children an opportunity to play hockey, 
15
leveraging the sport to build character, foster posi-
16
tive values, and develop important life skills. 
17
(10) Through Hockey is for Everyone pro-
18
grams, more than 120,000 boys and girls have been 
19
positively impacted. O’Ree has devoted nearly 2,500 
20
days on the ground with the youth participants, vis-
21
iting more than 500 schools, community centers, and 
22
rinks to speak to hockey’s core values and beliefs: 
23
stay in school; set goals for yourself; remain com-

mitted and disciplined; and always respect your 
1
teammates, coaches, and parents. 
2
(11) Hockey is for Everyone programs have 
3
provided important opportunities for youth to par-
4
take in physical fitness. Today in the United States, 
5
fewer than half of the children ages 6–11 engage in 
6
the recommended amount of physical activity, and 
7
that number is lower for low-income families. O’Ree 
8
has stood as a champion of youth athletic participa-
9
tion and its health benefits for decades. 
10
(12) Hockey is for Everyone programs provide 
11
numerous off-ice services to youth: SAT and aca-
12
demic tutoring, mentoring, nutrition education, col-
13
lege counseling, community service opportunities, 
14
and more. The program has excelled at using hockey 
15
as a vehicle to improve the social and emotional 
16
wellness of youth and improve students’ academic 
17
performances both in primary school and beyond. 
18
(13) O’Ree was also named a Member of the 
19
Order of Canada in 2008 and, in 2018, the City of 
20
Boston released an official Proclamation recognizing 
21
January 18, the anniversary of the day he broke 
22
into the game, as ‘‘Willie O’Ree Day’’. 
23
(14) In November 2018, 60 years after O’Ree 
24
entered the NHL, he was inducted into the Hockey

of children throughout North America.
