•HR 392 IH
(1) the Government Accountability Office has 
1
reported that the Federal Government often leases 
2
high-security space from private sector landlords; 
3
(2) the General Services Administration and 
4
other Federal agencies with leasing authority are not 
5
currently required to collect beneficial ownership in-
6
formation and therefore do not know if foreign own-
7
ers have a stake in the buildings leased by the agen-
8
cies, even when the leased space is used for classified 
9
operations or to store sensitive data; and 
10
(3) according to a report of the Government 
11
Accountability Office, dated January 2017, that ex-
12
amined the risks of foreign ownership of Govern-
13
ment-leased real estate, ‘‘leasing space in foreign- 
14
owned buildings could present security risks such as 
15
espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical ac-
16
cess’’.
