2 
•HR 5190 IH
(1) Telemedicine involving the delivery of safe, 
1
effective, quality health care services by a health 
2
care provider using electronic information technology 
3
as the mode of care delivery is a clinically appro-
4
priate and efficient method of furnishing many 
5
health care services. 
6
(2) Consultations between health care providers 
7
utilizing electronic information technology (in this 
8
section referred to as ‘‘E–Consult services’’) are fea-
9
sible in a variety of settings, flexible in their applica-
10
tion, and particularly useful in facilitating the timely 
11
provision of information from a clinician with spe-
12
cialized knowledge of a relevant medical subject mat-
13
ter to a treating clinician in order to improve care 
14
quality. 
15
(3) E–Consult services formalize the role of 
16
medical specialists, can be undertaken entirely with-
17
in electronic exchange platforms that are private and 
18
secure, and do not require synchronous communica-
19
tion between providers. 
20
(4) E–Consult services conducted in advance of 
21
a telemedicine service can improve the effectiveness 
22
of the subsequent telemedicine service. 
23
(5) E–Consult services are being utilized exten-
24
sively by the Veterans Health Administration and by 
25

•HR 5190 IH
a growing number of academic medical centers and 
1
other public and private health care settings both in 
2
the United States and internationally. 
3
(6) There is a need for additional extensive and 
4
rigorous research studies to determine best practices 
5
and processes for E–Consult services and to validate 
6
the impact on access to specialty medical care, costs, 
7
and clinical outcomes. 
8
(7) Providing the expertise and technical assist-
9
ance necessary to implement E–Consult services in 
10
primary care settings could improve access to spe-
11
cialty care at relatively low cost while simultaneously 
12
providing a testbed to evaluate the merits of varying 
13
approaches to E–Consult services, ascertain the 
14
value of such programs, and experiment with service 
15
reimbursement strategies in fee-for-service environ-
16
ments, including value-based care delivery arrange-
17
ments such as through accountable care organiza-
18
tions.
