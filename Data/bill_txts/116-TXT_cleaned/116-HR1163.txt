RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 25th anniversary of the Dayton Peace 
Accords. 
Whereas, December 14, 2020, marks the 25th anniversary of 
the Dayton Peace Accords that ended the war in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina and brought peace to Bosnia and 
Herzegovina; 
Whereas ethnic cleansing and concentration camps were used 
as a tool of war against Bosnian Muslim men, women, 
and children, culminating in the July 1995 genocide at 
Srebrenica, where 8,000 Muslim men and teenagers were 
detained and killed; 
Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
and the United States initiated airstrikes against Bos-
nian Serbs to stop grave human rights abuses, which led 
to ceasefire negotiations and the peace accords;

Whereas negotiations began on November 1, 1995, in Day-
ton, Ohio, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, led by 
then-negotiator Richard Holbrooke and then-Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, with Chairman of the Presi-
dency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic´, Presi-
dent of the Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milosˇevic´, Presi-
dent of the Republic of Croatia Franjo Tudjman, Euro-
pean Union Special Representative Carl Bildt, First Dep-
uty Foreign Minister of Russia Igor Ivanov, and rep-
resentatives from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, 
and Italy; 
Whereas, after days of extensive discussions, a historic peace 
agreement was signed on December 14, 1995, to halt the 
conflict and bring peace to the region; 
Whereas, despite seemingly insurmountable differences in 
opinions, the negotiations succeeded due to dedicated for-
eign service professionals, a common yearning for a 
peaceful resolution, and an outpouring of support from 
the global community; 
Whereas the General Framework Agreement for Peace in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, also known as the Dayton 
Peace Accords, laid the groundwork for NATO and Euro-
pean Union (EU) stabilization missions over the past 25 
years, which have allowed the citizens of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to live peacefully and prosper; 
Whereas the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, established in 
2006, remains the only literary peace prize awarded in 
the United States and recognizes the power of the writ-
ten word to promote peace, and after the death of Am-
bassador Holbrooke in 2011, the Lifetime Achievement 
Award was renamed the Richard C. Holbrooke Distin-
guished Achievement Award;

Whereas the United States Government reaffirms support for 
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s sovereignty and upholds the 
commitment to equality for all ethnicities according to 
the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina; and 
Whereas, since the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, the
