A BILL

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Speak Up to Protect 
4
Every Abused Kid Act’’.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

It is the sense of Congress that— 
7
(1) children are dependent on the adults in 
8

ers, health care providers, and others in their com-
1
munity, to ensure their safety and well-being; 
2
(2) data from the Administration on Children 
3
and Families for 2016 indicate that 671,622 chil-
4
dren in the United States were reported as being 
5
victims of child abuse or neglect, and 1,447 of those 
6
children died as a result of such abuse or neglect; 
7
(3) regardless of whether an adult is legally re-
8
quired to report child abuse and neglect, every adult 
9
who suspects or knows about child abuse or neglect 
10
has a moral duty to report such concerns to the ap-
11
propriate authorities; and 
12
(4) establishing a Federal standard for the 
13
classes of individuals that State law establishes as 
14
mandated reporters will protect children and ensure 
15
greater consistency among the laws of States, while 
16
allowing States the flexibility to establish additional 
17
classes of individuals as mandated reporters.
