a stable and prosperous world; 
17
(2) United States leadership is indispensable in 
18
light of the many complex and interconnected

4
of the instruments of national security and foreign 
5
policy at its disposal to protect United States citi-
6
zens, promote United States interests and values,

and support global stability and prosperity;

(6) United States security and prosperity de-
9
pend on having partners and allies that share our in-
10
terests and values, and these partnerships are nur-
11
tured and our shared interests and values are pro-
12
moted through United States diplomatic engage-
13
ment, security cooperation, economic statecraft, and 
14
assistance that helps further economic development, 
15
good governance, including the rule of law and

makes the United States and the world safer and

hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and other infectious dis-

16
projection of United States power and leadership 
17
worldwide, and without which Americans would be 
18
less safe, our economic power would be diminished,

and global stability and prosperity would suffer;

before conflicts break out saves American lives while
