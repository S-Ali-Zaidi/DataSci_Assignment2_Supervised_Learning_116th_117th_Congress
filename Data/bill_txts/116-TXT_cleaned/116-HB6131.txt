A BILL 
To direct the Architect of the Capitol to replace the bust 
of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court Cham-
ber of the United States Capitol with a bust of Thurgood 
Marshall to be obtained by the Joint Committee on the 
Library, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) While sitting in the United States Capitol, 
5
the Supreme Court issued the infamous Dred Scott 
6
00:36 Mar 14, 2020

•HR 6131 IH
v. Sandford decision on March 6, 1857. Written by 
1
Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, whose bust sits 
2
inside the entrance to the Old Supreme Court 
3
Chamber in the United States Capitol, this opinion 
4
declared that African Americans were not citizens of 
5
the United States and could not sue in Federal 
6
courts. This decision further declared that Congress 
7
did not have the authority to prohibit slavery in the 
8
territories. 
9
(2) Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney’s author-
10
ship of Dred Scott v. Sandford, the effects of which 
11
would only be overturned years later by the ratifica-
12
tion of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the 
13
Constitution of the United States, renders a bust of 
14
his likeness unsuitable for the honor of display to 
15
the many visitors to the United States Capitol. 
16
(3) As Frederick Douglass said of this decision 
17
in May 1857, ‘‘This infamous decision of the Slave-
18
holding wing of the Supreme Court maintains that 
19
slaves are within the contemplation of the Constitu-
20
tion of the United States, property; that slaves are 
21
property in the same sense that horses, sheep, and 
22
swine are property; that the old doctrine that slavery 
23
is a creature of local law is false; that the right of 
24
the slaveholder to his slave does not depend upon 
25

•HR 6131 IH
the local law, but is secured wherever the Constitu-
1
tion of the United States extends; that Congress has 
2
no right to prohibit slavery anywhere; that slavery 
3
may go in safety anywhere under the star-spangled 
4
banner; that colored persons of African descent have 
5
no rights that white men are bound to respect; that 
6
colored men of African descent are not and cannot 
7
be citizens of the United States.’’. 
8
(4) While the removal of Chief Justice Roger 
9
Brooke Taney’s bust from the United States Capitol 
10
does not relieve the Congress of the historical 
11
wrongs it committed to protect the institution of 
12
slavery, it expresses Congress’s recognition of one of 
13
the most notorious wrongs to have ever taken place 
14
in one of its rooms, that of Chief Justice Roger 
15
Brooke Taney’s Dred Scott v. Sandford decision.
