A BILL 
To increase the participation of historically underrepresented 
demographic groups in science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics education and industry. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women and Minorities

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the National Academy of 
1
Sciences, STEM education at the undergraduate 
2
level is vital to developing a workforce that will allow 
3
the United States to remain the leader in the 21st 
4
century global economy. 
5
(2) According to the 2013 American Commu-
6
nity Survey Report on disparities in STEM employ-
7
ment, women comprise about half of the United 
8
States workforce but only make up 26 percent of 
9
STEM workers. 
10
(3) According to the National Center of Edu-
11
cation Statistics, women were more likely than men 
12
to switch out of STEM majors—32 percent vs. 26 
13
percent. 
14
(4) According to the 2010 Association of Amer-
15
ican University Women report ‘‘Why So Few?’’ ap-
16
proximately 52 percent of women in STEM fields 
17
quit their jobs about 10 years into their careers. It 
18
is important for gender equality to increase the re-
19
tention of women in STEM fields, as women in 
20
STEM careers earn 33 percent more than those in 
21
non-STEM jobs, and have a smaller wage gap rel-
22
ative to men. 
23
(5) According to recent Census Bureau projec-
24
tions, minorities will account for 57 percent of the 
25

United States population by 2060. According to the 
1
National Action Council for Minorities in Engineer-
2
ing, Inc., as the United States works to remain com-
3
petitive in the world of technological innovation, the 
4
United States should address the need to increase 
5
the number of individuals from underrepresented mi-
6
nority segments of the population who work in engi-
7
neering. 
8
(6) The Higher Education Research Institute at 
9
the University of California, Los Angeles, found 
10
that, while freshmen from underrepresented minority 
11
groups express an interest in pursuing a STEM un-
12
dergraduate degree at the same rate as all other 
13
freshmen, only 22.1 percent of Latino students, 18.4 
14
percent of African-American students, and 18.8 per-
15
cent of Native American students studying in STEM 
16
fields complete their degree within 5 years, com-
17
pared to an approximate 33 percent and 42 percent 
18
5-year completion rate for White and Asian stu-
19
dents, respectively. 
20
(7) According to the 2015 Asian Americans Ad-
21
vancing Justice report ‘‘Making America Work’’, 
22
data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
23
(AAPIs) on average hide the fact that some sub-
24
groups are underrepresented in STEM fields. For

example: only 9 percent of Cambodian, 8 percent of 
1
Laotian, 8 percent of Hmong, and 7 percent of Na-
2
tive Hawaiian and Pacific Islander workers hold 
3
STEM jobs, compared to 12 percent of the total 
4
American population holding STEM jobs. 
5
(8) According to 3-year estimates from the 
6
2013 American Community Survey, Southeast Asian 
7
Americans and Pacific Islanders have higher poverty 
8
rates and lower educational attainment rates com-
9
pared to the overall population. Fifteen percent of 
10
the overall population lives below the Federal pov-
11
erty level, while 21 percent of Pacific Islanders, 21 
12
percent of Cambodian, 26 percent of Hmong, 17 
13
percent of Laotian, and 16 percent of Vietnamese 
14
community members live in poverty. Compared to 29 
15
percent of the overall population with a bachelor’s 
16
degree or higher, members of Pacific Islanders, 
17
Cambodian, Hmong, Lao, and Vietnamese commu-
18
nities only have a bachelor’s degree or higher at 
19
rates of 15 percent, 16 percent, 16 percent, 13 per-
20
cent, and 27 percent, respectively. Levels of poverty 
21
and postsecondary educational attainment correlate 
22
with these groups’ underrepresentation in STEM 
23
employment. Other Asian American and Pacific Is-
24
lander subgroups with similar poverty and edu-

cational attainment rates are similarly underrep-
1
resented in STEM employment. 
2
(9) A 2014 National Center for Education Sta-
3
tistics study found that women and underrep-
4
resented minorities leave the STEM fields at higher 
5
rates than their counterparts, leading to a need to 
6
develop resources to retain these groups in the 
7
STEM fields.
