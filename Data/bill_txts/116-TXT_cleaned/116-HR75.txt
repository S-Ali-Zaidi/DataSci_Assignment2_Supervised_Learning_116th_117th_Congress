Whereas Kenyan security forces rescued more than 700 civil-
ians from the complex; 
Whereas al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist organi-
zation based in Somalia designated as a foreign terrorist 
organization by the Department of State, has claimed re-
sponsibility for the attack on the 14 Riverside Complex; 
Whereas Kenya has previously been a target for al-Qaeda af-
filiated terrorist attacks in August 1998, when the 
United States embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and the 
United States embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were 
simultaneously bombed, killing 224 people and injuring 
over 5,000 people; 
Whereas al-Shabaab has previously perpetrated numerous 
mass-casualty terrorist attacks in Kenya, notably the 
siege at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in September 
2013, which killed 67 people, and the assault on Garissa 
University College in April 2015, which killed 148 people; 
Whereas the United States and Kenya share a longstanding 
and mutually beneficial political, economic, and security 
partnership; and 
Whereas security cooperation between the United States and 
Kenya plays an essential role in combating terrorism and 
violent extremism in the Horn of Africa, particularly ef-
forts to combat al-Shabaab; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
