nizing the necessity of investing in workforce develop-
ment to support workers and to help employers succeed 
in a global economy.

United States with the skilled workers needed to thrive 
in a global economy; 
Whereas collaboration among Governors, local governments, 
State and local education leaders, workforce, and human 
services agencies, community colleges, local businesses, 
employment service providers, community-based organiza-
tions, labor organizations, and workforce development 
boards provides for long-term, sustainable, and successful 
workforce development across traditional sectors and 
emerging industries; 
Whereas middle-skill jobs, those that require more than a 
high school diploma but not a 4-year degree, comprise 53 
percent of the labor market, and our workforce system is 
tasked with making sure that all workers, particularly 
those with barriers to employment, access the skills they 
need for these jobs and employment; 
Whereas, in 2014, Congress reauthorized the Workforce In-
novation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) 
with overwhelming bipartisan support in recognition of 
the need to strengthen the focus of the United States on 
the skills necessary to fill jobs in local and regional in-
dustries and in-demand industry sectors or occupations; 
Whereas the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 
U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) supports employment, training, and 
support services for individuals with barriers to employ-
ment, including, but not limited to— 
(1) individuals who are low-income; 
(2) individuals who are out of work; 
(3) individuals with disabilities; 
(4) individuals who are older; 
(5) individuals who are facing homelessness;

(6) youth who have aged out of the foster care sys-
tem; 
(7) individuals who are English-language learners, 
individuals who have low levels of literacy, and individ-
uals facing substantial cultural barriers; 
(8) individuals who were formerly incarcerated; and 
(9) long-term unemployed individuals; 
Whereas the more than 550 workforce development boards 
and 2,500 American Job Centers are a driving force be-
hind growing regional economies because they provide 
training, resources, and assistance to workers who aim to 
compete in the 21st century economy; 
Whereas ongoing State and local implementation of the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 
3101 et seq.) provides unprecedented opportunities to de-
velop the skills of workers in the United States through 
access to effective workforce education and training, in-
cluding the development and delivery of proven strategies 
such as sector partnerships, career pathways, integrated 
education and training, work-based learning models, and 
paid internships; 
Whereas, in 2018, programs authorized under the Workforce 
Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et 
seq.)— 
(1) served more than 6,000,000 young people and 
adults; 
(2) exceeded employment targets across all pro-
grams; and 
(3) helped more than 1,500,000 individuals, includ-
ing English-language learners, gain skills and credentials 
to help the individuals succeed in the labor market;

•HRES 578 IH 
Whereas State programs established under the Wagner- 
Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.)— 
(1) ensured that more than 5,400,000 unemployed 
workers, including more than 500,000 veterans, had ac-
cess to career services through American Job Centers in 
2018; and 
(2) support State efforts to offer intensive reemploy-
ment services; 
Whereas workforce development programs will play a critical 
role in addressing the expected 2,400,000 unfilled manu-
facturing jobs over the next decade; 
Whereas community colleges and other workforce develop-
ment training providers across the United States are 
well-situated— 
(1) to train the next generation of workers in the 
United States; and 
(2) to address the educational challenges created by 
emerging industries and technological advancements; 
Whereas participation in a career and technical education (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘CTE’’) program decreases 
the risk of students dropping out of high school, and all 
50 States and the District of Columbia report higher 
graduation rates for CTE students, as compared with 
other students; 
Whereas many community and technical colleges operate as 
open access institutions serving millions of students an-
nually at a comparatively low cost; 
Whereas the Strengthening Career and Technical Education 
for the 21st Century Act (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.) sup-
ports the development and implementation of high-quality 
CTE programs that—

(1) combine rigorous academic content with occupa-
tional skills; and 
(2) served approximately 12,000,000 high school 
and college students from 2017 to 2018; 
Whereas there are more than 500,000 Registered Apprentices 
in the United States, and there is growing and bipartisan 
support for expanding paid, on-the-job training strategies 
to help current and future workers gain skills and work 
experience; 
Whereas the federally supported workforce system and part-
ner programs— 
(1) have helped rebuild the economy of the United 
States and provide increased economic opportunities; 
(2) provide a pathway into jobs that support families 
and lead to socioeconomic mobility while helping busi-
nesses in the United States find the skilled workforce 
needed to compete in the global economy; and 
(3) support individuals who have been displaced and 
provide opportunities for workers to learn new skills to 
access better paying jobs in a changing economy; and 
Whereas workforce development is crucial to sustaining eco-
nomic security for workers in the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it
