RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of International Myalgic 
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Awareness 
Day. 
Whereas the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), formerly 
known as the Institute of Medicine, has found Myalgic 
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) 
to be ‘‘a serious, chronic, complex, and systemic disease 
that frequently and dramatically limits the activities of 
affected patients’’; 
Whereas between 836,000 and 2,500,000 individuals of all 
ages, races, and sexes in the United States are believed 
to be afflicted with ME/CFS, with millions more afflicted 
by ME/CFS worldwide, and the vast majority of individ-
uals with ME/CFS are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed;

Whereas ME/CFS is approximately 4 times more prevalent in 
women than in men; 
Whereas ME/CFS is a chronic disease with no known cure 
and leaves 1⁄4 of individuals with ME/CFS housebound or 
bedbound for extended periods of time; 
Whereas 50 to 75 percent of individuals with ME/CFS can-
not work or attend school; 
Whereas medical expenses and lost productivity related to 
ME/CFS cost the economy of the United States an esti-
mated $17,000,000,000 to $24,000,000,000 annually; 
Whereas the cause of ME/CFS is unknown, there is no diag-
nostic test for ME/CFS, and there is no treatment for 
ME/CFS that is approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration; 
Whereas NAM has noted a ‘‘paucity of research’’ on ME/ 
CFS and that ‘‘more research is essential’’; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) has called ME/CFS ‘‘America’s Hidden Health 
Crisis’’; 
Whereas individuals with ME/CFS struggle to find doctors to 
care for them, and ME/CFS is included in the curricula 
of fewer than 1⁄3 of medical schools; 
Whereas in recognition of the dearth of research on ME/CFS 
and the profound impact that the disease has on individ-
uals with ME/CFS and their loved ones and caretakers, 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is ‘‘committed to 
unraveling the underlying biologic cause(s) of ME/CFS 
as swiftly as possible, and promoting research that will 
inform the development of effective strategies for treat-
ment and prevention of this devastating condition’’;

Whereas, in 2017, 11 Institutes at the NIH and the Office 
of the Director of the NIH contributed more than 
$7,000,000 in grants to assist in establishing Collabo-
rative Research Centers and a Data Management Coordi-
nating Center to improve the coordination of ME/CFS 
research and help accelerate understanding of ME/CFS; 
and 
Whereas, in 2019, May 12 is recognized as International ME/ 
CFS Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it
