995,600 or 4 percent of children under the age of 
1
6 in the United States had elevated blood lead levels 
2
above the CDC reference value of 5 micrograms per 
3
deciliter (μg/dL); 
4
(2) there is no safe level of lead poisoning; 
5
(3) according to the CDC, the effects of lead 
6
poisoning are immediate and permanent—childhood 
7
exposure to lead, even at very low levels, can have 
8
lifelong consequences, including decreased IQ and 
9
cognitive function, developmental delays, and behav-
10
ioral problems; 
11
(4) higher exposures to lead at a young age can 
12
cause seizures, coma, and even death; 
13
(5) according to the National Housing Law 
14
Project, there are over 90,400 children in the United 
15
States living in housing assisted under the Housing 
16
Choice Voucher Program who have lead poisoning 
17
and there are an additional 340,000 children living 
18
in federally assisted housing who are at risk; 
19
(6) under current program rules, children 
20
whose families participate in the Housing Choice 
21

22

and 
2
(8) while some localities have required property 
3
owners to conduct risk assessments and abate lead 
4
when a child under the age of 6 will reside in a 
5
dwelling unit, there has been evidence that such poli-
6
cies led to augmented instances of housing discrimi-
7
nation on the basis of familial status, making hous-
8
ing opportunities less available for families with chil-

10
such families.
