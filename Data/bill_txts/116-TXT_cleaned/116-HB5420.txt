(1) in 1970, the Secretary of the Interior des-
1
ignated the Pullman Historic District as a National 
2
Historic Landmark District because of— 
3
(A) the significance of the District to the 
4
labor history, social history, architecture, and 
5
urban planning of the United States; and 
6
(B) the pivotal role of events in the Dis-
7
trict in creating the first national Labor Day 
8
holiday in the world; 
9
(2) between 1880 and 1884, George M. Pull-
10
man, owner of the Pullman Palace Car Company, 
11
built the Pullman community, which was envisioned 
12
by Pullman as an industrial town that would provide 
13
employees with— 
14
(A) a model community; and 
15
(B) suitable living conditions; 
16
(3) the town developed by George M. Pullman, 
17
which consisted of over 1,000 buildings and homes, 
18
was awarded ‘‘The World’s Most Perfect Town’’ at 
19
the International Hygienic and Pharmaceutical Ex-
20
position in 1896; 
21
(4) the Pullman factory site is a true symbol of 
22
the historic struggle in the United States to achieve 
23
fair labor practices for the working class, with the

original factory serving as the catalyst for the first 
1
industry-wide strike in the United States; 
2
(5) in the midst of economic depression in 
3
1894, to protest unsafe conditions and reductions in 
4
pay, Pullman factory workers initiated a strike 
5
that— 
6
(A) when taken up as a cause by the 
7
American Railway Union, crippled the entire 
8
rail industry; 
9
(B) continued even in the face of a Federal 
10
injunction and a showdown between laborers 
11
and Federal troops that turned violent and 
12
deadly; and 
13
(C) set a national example for the ability 
14
of working people in the United States to 
15
change the existing system in favor of more just 
16
practices for protecting workers’ rights and 
17
safety; 
18
(6) following the deaths of a number of workers 
19
at the hands of the United States military and 
20
United States Marshals during the 1894 strike, Con-
21
gress unanimously voted to approve rush legislation 
22
that created a national Labor Day holiday, which 
23
was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland 
24
6 days after the end of the strike;

(7) the Pullman Palace Car Company also 
1
played an important role in African-American and 
2
early civil rights history through the legacy of the 
3
Pullman porters, many of whom were ex-slaves and 
4
employed in a heavily discriminatory environment 
5
immediately following the Civil War; 
6
(8) the Pullman porters, who served diligently 
7
between the 1870s and the 1960s, have been com-
8
mended for— 
9
(A) their level of service and attention to 
10
detail; and 
11
(B) their contributions to the development 
12
of the African-American middle class; 
13
(9) the information, ideas, and commerce the 
14
Pullman porters carried across the country while 
15
traveling on trains helped to bring education and 
16
wealth to African-American communities throughout 
17
the United States; 
18
(10) the positive role of the Pullman porters in 
19
the historical image of the first-class service that 
20
was made available on Pullman cars is unmistak-
21
able; 
22
(11) the Pullman community was the seminal 
23
home to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, 
24
which—

(B) was the first African-American labor 
3
union with a collective bargaining agreement; 
4
(C) fought— 
5
(i) against discrimination; and 
6
(ii) in support of just labor practices; 
7
and 
8
(D) helped lay the groundwork for what 
9
became the great Civil Rights Movement of the 
10
20th Century; 
11
(12) the Pullman community is— 
12
(A) a paramount illustration of the work of 
13
architect Solon Spencer Beman; 
14
(B) a well-preserved example of 19th cen-
15
tury community planning, architecture, and 
16
landscape design; and 
17
(C) comprised of a number of historic 
18
structures, including the Administration Clock 
19
Tower Building, Hotel Florence, Greenstone 
20
Church, Market Square, and hundreds of units 
21
of rowhouses built for Pullman workers; 
22
(13) the preservation of the Pullman site has 
23
been threatened by— 
24
(A) plans for demolition in 1960; and

(B) a fire in 1998, which damaged the

iconic clock tower and the rear erecting shops;

(14) the diligent efforts of community organiza-
3
tions, foundations, nonprofit organizations, resi-
4
dents, the State, and units of local government in 
5
the restoration and preservation of the District after 
6
the 1998 fire were vital to the protection of the Pull-
7
man site; 
8
(15) due to the historic and architectural sig-
9
nificance of the District, the District is designated 
10
as— 
11
(A) a registered National Historic Land-
12
mark District; 
13
(B) an Illinois State Landmark; and 
14
(C) a City of Chicago Landmark District;

and

(16) the preservation, enhancement, economic, 
17
and tourism potential and management of the im-
18
portant historic and architectural resources of the

Park requires cooperation and partnerships from

among local property owners, the Federal Govern-
