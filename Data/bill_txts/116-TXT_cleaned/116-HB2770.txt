SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Huntington’s Disease 
2
Parity Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) Huntington’s disease is a progressive degen-
6
erative neurological disease that causes total phys-
7
ical and mental deterioration. In the United States, 
8
approximately 30,000 individuals are affected by 
9
Huntington’s disease, along with another 200,000 
10
individuals who are genetically ‘‘at risk’’. There is no 
11
effective treatment in terms of halting or slowing the 
12
progression of the disease. 
13
(2) Clinical indicators of Huntington’s disease 
14
include— 
15
(A) loss of ability to control bodily move-
16
ments; 
17
(B) loss of ability to think or act quickly, 
18
inability to learn new material, and loss of 
19
memory; and 
20
(C) behavioral or psychological problems, 
21
including personality changes, irritability, mood 
22
swings, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, 
23
inability to concentrate, decreased motivation, 
24
and severe depression.

(3) Adult-onset Huntington’s disease typically 
1
results in the development of symptoms in individ-
2
uals between 30 and 50 years of age. Late-onset 
3
Huntington’s disease is characterized by develop-
4
ment of symptoms after 50 years of age and is usu-
5
ally associated with a milder course of the disease. 
6
Juvenile Huntington’s disease affects individuals 
7
who have yet to attain 19 years of age and pro-
8
gresses at a more rapid rate. 
9
(4) Because of the incapacitating nature of 
10
Huntington’s disease, individuals living with this ill-
11
ness, including those in the early stages of the dis-
12
ease, are unable to retain employment. As a result, 
13
many such individuals rely solely on Social Security 
14
Disability Insurance. 
15
(5) After qualifying for Social Security Dis-
16
ability Insurance, individuals with Huntington’s dis-
17
ease must wait another 24 months before receiving 
18
benefits under the Medicare program, despite the 
19
fact that such individuals often become incapacitated 
20
before reaching the age-eligibility requirement under 
21
the Medicare program of 65 years of age. 
22
(6) In 2000, the Centers for Medicare & Med-
23
icaid Services waived the 24-month waiting period 
24
requirement for people disabled by amyotrophic lat-

eral sclerosis (‘‘ALS’’), a degenerative neurological 
1
condition that is similar to Huntington’s disease. 
2
(7) In light of the significant cognitive, behav-
3
ioral, and physical incapacitation faced by individ-
4
uals with this disease, there is an urgent need for 
5
the removal of the 24-month waiting period for cov-
6
erage under the Medicare program for such individ-
7
uals, similar to the existing exemption for individ-
8
uals who have been diagnosed with ALS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 226(h) of the Social Secu-
14
rity Act (42 U.S.C. 426(h)) is amended, in the matter pre-
15
ceding paragraph (1), by inserting ‘‘or Huntington’s dis-
16
ease (HD)’’ after ‘‘amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)’’. 
17
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by 
18
subsection (a) shall apply to benefits under title XVIII of 
19
the Social Security Act with respect to items and services 
20
furnished in months beginning after the date of the enact-
21
ment of this Act.
