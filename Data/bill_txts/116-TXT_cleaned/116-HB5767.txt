SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) There are 700 Eritrean nationals living in 
3
the United States who have final orders of removal. 
4
(2) In September 2017, the Secretary of Home-
5
land Security announced visa sanctions to encourage 
6
certain recalcitrant countries, including Eritrea, to 
7
accept the respective nationals from such countries 
8
who are subject to final orders of removal from the 
9
United States. 
10
(3) Eritrea has generally declined to issue trav-
11
el documents to accept such nationals upon removal 
12
from the United States but has begun to issue such 
13
documents due to the threat of visa sanctions from 
14
the United States. 
15
(4) The human rights crisis and humanitarian 
16
situation in Eritrea has resulted in extraordinary 
17
conditions that have driven nationals to flee the 
18
country and prevented such nationals from safely re-
19
turning to Eritrea. 
20
(5) Conditions in Eritrea have been historically 
21
dangerous and oppressive for certain groups that 
22
frequently suffer state reprisal, including individuals 
23
who have fled Eritrea to evade indefinite military 
24
service and arbitrary detention, conscientious objec-

tors, opponents of political leaders in Eritrea, jour-
1
nalists, and religious minorities. 
2
(6) If returned to Eritrea after removal from 
3
the United States, many Eritrean nationals that be-
4
long to such groups may face persecution, torture, 
5
or death. 
6
(7) Eritrean nationals who are removed from 
7
the United States are also at a particular risk of 
8
state reprisal for leaving in the first place. 
9
(8) The most recent report of the United Na-
10
tions Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
11
rights in Eritrea assessed current country conditions 
12
as grim, with arbitrary arrests, detentions, tortures, 
13
disappearances, and extrajudicial executions occur-
14
ring regularly. 
15
(9) Human rights violations, including indefi-
16
nite military service, overcrowding in prolonged, un-
17
sanitary detention, and an overall lack of freedom of 
18
movement and expression, persist in Eritrea, con-
19
tributing to the mass exodus from the country. 
20
(10) United Nations Special Rapporteurs in 
21
Eritrea have determined that this situation is forc-
22
ing many Eritrean nationals to choose between en-
23
slavement if they stay in Eritrea or death if they at-
24
tempt to leave Eritrea.

•HR 5767 IH
(11) The most recent State Department report 
1
on human rights practices in Eritrea warns that 
2
many citizens who have fled Eritrea ‘‘remain in self- 
3
imposed exile due to their religious and political 
4
views and fear that they would be conscripted into 
5
national service if returned,’’ which may result in 
6
torture and death. 
7
(12) In order to begin to restore immigration 
8
relations with the United States, Eritrea will need to 
9
adopt accountability measures that ensure that Eri-
10
trean nationals returned to Eritrea do not face state 
11
reprisal. 
12
(13) In 2018, the co-chairs of the Tom Lantos 
13
Human Rights Commission reiterated these concerns 
14
in a bipartisan delegation letter to the Secretary of 
15
State, urging the Department of State to ensure 
16
human rights objectives were taken into consider-
17
ation when resetting any relations or policies toward 
18
Eritrea. 
19
(14) In 2017, the Director of U.S. Immigration 
20
and Customs Enforcement sought to remove ap-
21
proximately 700 Eritrean nationals from the United 
22
States. 
23
(15) Without enough time to seek immigration 
24
assistance based on country conditions in Eritrea, 
25
22:33 Feb 06, 2020
H5767

•HR 5767 IH
and without careful consideration for each case, Eri-
1
trean nationals could be removed to face persecution, 
2
torture, or death before such Eritreans receive fair 
3
adjudication of eligibility for relief under current law 
4
and in light of present facts. 
5
(16) Deferring removal of Eritrean nationals 
6
for 24 months would give— 
7
(A) such Eritreans, who have not had the 
8
time or resources to seek sufficient immigration 
9
assistance or legal counsel based on the unique 
10
circumstances described in this section, time to 
11
seek such assistance or counsel; 
12
(B) immigration judges and authorities the 
13
time to fully understand the dire human rights 
14
crisis and humanitarian situation in Eritrea; 
15
and 
16
(C) the Government of Eritrea time to 
17
start to reform the security of Eritrea and ad-
18
dress human rights abuses within Eritrea, in-
19
cluding preventing indefinite military service, 
20
arbitrary and prolonged detention, and general 
21
persecution of the Eritrean people. 
22
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
23
It is the sense of Congress that— 
24
22:33 Feb 06, 2020
H5767
6 
•HR 5767 IH
(1) Eritrean nationals should not be deported 
1
to Eritrea if such nationals face persecution, torture, 
2
or death; 
3
(2) due to the horrific conditions in Eritrea, in-
4
cluding conditions listed under section 2, and the 
5
substantial increase in removal orders for Eritrean 
6
aliens in the United States, it would both be unfair 
7
and dangerous to deport Eritreans without ensuring 
8
that each case is carefully considered or, if applica-
9
ble, reconsidered based on current country condi-
10
tions in Eritrea; and 
11
(3) the removal of Eritrean nationals described 
12
in section 4 should be deferred for a period of 24 
13
months, at the end of which Congress should have 
14
the opportunity to reevaluate conditions in Eritrea.
