•HR 1565 IH
(1) facilitate the compilation of statistical data 
1
necessary to create a robust and useful higher edu-
2
cation data system while minimizing the privacy and 
3
security risks by using commercially available tech-
4
nology that, at a minimum, uses technical protection 
5
measures that reasonably ensure that—

(A) a reporting entity’s raw data, including

personally identifiable information, shall not be 
8
accessible through the system to the Depart-
9
ment or any party other than the reporting en-
10
tity;

12
nents used in the system is revealed by the sys-

described in section 5; and

17
tify an individual is revealed by the system to

sioner, directly and not by grant or contract, to per-
21
form statistical queries necessary to determine the 
22
outcome metrics described in section 5 using the 
23
data components submitted by the reporting entities;

(4) minimize, to the extent possible using com-
9
mercially available technology, the privacy risks to
