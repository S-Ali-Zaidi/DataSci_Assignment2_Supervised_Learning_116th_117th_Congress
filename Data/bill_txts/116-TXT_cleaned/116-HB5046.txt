SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Nearing two decades after the September 
3
11 attacks against the United States, America con-
4
tinues the Global War on Terrorism, at great per-
5
sonal cost to men and women serving on active duty 
6
in the Nation’s Armed Forces and to those whose 
7
support they depend upon to fulfill their duties. 
8
(2) Civil servants from Federal agencies, the in-
9
telligence community, local emergency responders, 
10
and other civilian support personnel have made sig-
11
nificant sacrifices in their service in the Global War 
12
on Terrorism. 
13
(3) Honoring the losses endured by these indi-
14
viduals and their families, in 2017 Congress unani-
15
mously passed and the President signed Public Law 
16
115–51, which allowed the Global War on Terrorism 
17
Memorial Foundation to establish a memorial to the 
18
fallen on Federal land in the District of Columbia. 
19
(4) Given the significance of the Global War on 
20
Terrorism as the longest-running conflict in United 
21
States history and the magnitude of the sacrifice in-
22
volved in these operations, it is appropriate to locate 
23
the memorial to the Global War on Terrorism within 
24
the Reserve alongside existing memorials to the Na-
25
tion’s major armed conflicts.
