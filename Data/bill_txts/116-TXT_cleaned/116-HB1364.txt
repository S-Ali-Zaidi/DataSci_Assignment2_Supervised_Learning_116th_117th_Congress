SEC. 501. SENSE OF SENATE. 
10
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
11
(1) from the prenatal period to the first day of 
12
kindergarten, children’s development rapidly pro-
13
gresses at a pace exceeding that of any subsequent 
14
stage of life; 
15
(2) as reported by the National Academy of 
16
Sciences in 2001, striking disparities exist in what 
17
children know and can do that are evident well be-
18
fore they enter kindergarten; these differences are 
19
strongly associated with social and economic cir-
20
cumstances, and they are predictive of subsequent 
21
academic performance; 
22
(3) research has consistently demonstrated that 
23
investments in high-quality programs that serve in-
24
fants and toddlers better position those children for 
25

success in elementary, secondary, and postsecondary 
1
education as well as helping children develop the 
2
critical physical, emotional, social, and cognitive 
3
skills that they will need for the rest of their lives; 
4
(4) in 2011, there were 11,000,000 infants and 
5
toddlers living in the United States and 49 percent 
6
of these children came from low-income families liv-
7
ing with incomes at or below 200 percent of the 
8
Federal poverty guidelines; 
9
(5) the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood 
10
Home Visiting (MIECHV) program was authorized 
11
by Congress to facilitate collaboration and partner-
12
ship at the Federal, State, and community levels to 
13
improve health and development outcomes for at-risk 
14
children, including those from low-income families, 
15
through evidence-based home visiting programs; 
16
(6) MIECHV is an evidence-based policy initia-
17
tive and its authorizing legislation requires that at 
18
least 75 percent of funds dedicated to the program 
19
must support programs to implement evidence-based 
20
home visiting models, which includes the home-based 
21
model of Early Head Start; 
22
(7) in fiscal year 2016, MIECHV served ap-
23
proximately 160,000 parents and children, which is 
24
only a small portion of those eligible, in 893 counties

more at-risk families voluntarily receive home visits

(A) promote maternal, infant, and child
