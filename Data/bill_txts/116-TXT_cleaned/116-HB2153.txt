SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress finds the following: 
11
(1) Adolescence is a critical period in a girl’s 
12
life, when significant physical, emotional, and social 
13
changes shape her future. 
14
(2) Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable 
15
to HIV/AIDS, child, early and forced marriage, and 
16
other forms of violence which are detrimental to 
17
their futures, as evidenced by the following statistics: 
18
(A) Each year, 380,000 adolescent girls 
19
and young women become newly infected with 
20
HIV, more than 1,000 every day, and comprise 
21
the fastest-growing demographic for new infec-
22
tions in sub-Saharan Africa.

•HR 2153 IH
(B) Each year, 12,000,000 adolescent girls 
1
around the world are married before their 18th 
2
birthday, and more than 650,000,000 women 
3
alive today were married as children. 
4
(C) Child marriages often interrupt school-
5
ing, limit opportunities, and impact the phys-
6
ical, psychological and social well-being of such 
7
girls. If there is no reduction in child marriage, 
8
the global number of women married as chil-
9
dren is projected to increase by 150,000,000 by 
10
2030. 
11
(D) One-quarter to one-half of girls in de-
12
veloping countries become mothers before the 
13
age of 18, and girls under 15 are five times 
14
more likely to die during childbirth than women 
15
in their 20s. 
16
(3) Approximately 130,000,000 girls around the 
17
world are not in school, and millions more are failing 
18
to acquire basic reading, writing, and numeracy 
19
skills. 
20
(4) Girls between the ages of 10 and 19 are 
21
three times more likely than boys to be kept out of 
22
school, particularly in countries affected by conflict. 
23
(5) Due to discriminatory gender norms and ex-
24
pectations, disparities in access to safe and quality 
25

•HR 2153 IH
education manifest early in a girl’s life and continue 
1
to become more pronounced throughout adolescence. 
2
(6) Girls living with disabilities are less likely to 
3
start school and transition to secondary school than 
4
boys living with disabilities and other children, and 
5
just 1 percent of women with disabilities are literate 
6
globally. 
7
(7) While two-thirds of all countries have 
8
achieved gender parity in primary education, only 40 
9
percent have achieved gender parity in secondary 
10
education. 
11
(8) Adolescent girls who remain in school are 
12
more likely to live longer, marry later, have healthier 
13
children, and, as adults, earn an income to support 
14
their families, thereby contributing to the economic 
15
advancement of communities and nations. 
16
(9) Since July 2015, more than 100 public-pri-
17
vate partnerships have been formed between the 
18
United States Government and external partners to 
19
support innovative and community-led solutions in 
20
targeted countries, including Malawi and Tanzania, 
21
to ensure adolescent girls receive a quality edu-
22
cation.

has brought together the Department of State, the 
1
United States Agency for International Develop-
2
ment, the Peace Corps, and the Millennium Chal-
3
lenge Corporation, as well as other agencies and pro-
4
grams such as the President’s Emergency Fund for 
5
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), to address the range of 
6
challenges preventing adolescent girls from attaining 
7
an inclusive and equitable quality education leading 
8
to relevant learning outcomes. 
9
(11) According to the United States Global 
10
Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls, which is the 
11
first foreign policy document in the world solely 
12
dedicated to the rights and empowerment of girls 
13
globally, ‘‘[w]hile the Millennium Development Goals 
14
improved outcomes for girls in primary education, 
15
they also highlighted the need for a targeted focus 
16
on adolescents and young adults, particularly re-
17
garding the transition to and completion of sec-
18
ondary school’’. 
19
(12) PEPFAR, through its DREAMS (Deter-
20
mined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, 
21
and Safe) Initiative, has worked to address a num-
22
ber of the specific barriers to education that adoles-
23
cent girls face.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) every child, regardless of place of birth, de-
3
serves an equal opportunity to access quality edu-
4
cation; 
5
(2) the United States has been a global leader 
6
in efforts to expand and improve educational oppor-
7
tunities for those who have been traditionally 
8
disenfranchised, particularly women and girls; 
9
(3) gains with respect to girls’ secondary edu-
10
cation and empowerment have been proven to cor-
11
relate strongly with progress in gender equality and 
12
women’s rights, as well as economic and social 
13
progress, and achieving gender equality should be a 
14
priority goal of United States foreign policy; 
15
(4) achieving gender parity in both access to 
16
and quality of educational opportunity contributes 
17
significantly to economic growth and development, 
18
thereby lowering the risk for violence and instability; 
19
and 
20
(5) education is a lifesaving humanitarian inter-
21
vention that protects the lives, futures, and well- 
22
being of girls.
