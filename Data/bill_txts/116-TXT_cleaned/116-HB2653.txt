To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe Schools Improve-
4
ment Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Bullying and harassment foster a climate of 
8
fear and disrespect that can seriously impair the

physical and psychological health of its victims and 
1
create conditions that negatively affect learning, 
2
thereby undermining the ability of students to 
3
achieve their full potential. 
4
(2) Bullying and harassment contribute to high 
5
dropout rates, increased absenteeism, and academic 
6
underachievement. 
7
(3) Bullying and harassment include a range of 
8
behaviors that negatively impact a student’s ability 
9
to learn and participate in educational opportunities 
10
and activities that schools offer. Such behaviors can 
11
include hitting or punching, name-calling, intimida-
12
tion through gestures or social exclusion, and send-
13
ing insulting or offensive messages through elec-
14
tronic communications, such as internet sites, e- 
15
mail, instant messaging, mobile phones and mes-
16
saging, telephone, or any other means. 
17
(4) Schools with enumerated anti-bullying and 
18
harassment policies have an increased level of re-
19
porting and teacher intervention in incidents of bul-
20
lying and harassment, thereby reducing the overall 
21
frequency and number of such incidents. 
22
(5) Students have been particularly singled out 
23
for bullying and harassment on the basis of their ac-
24
tual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, 
25

•HR 2653 IH
disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
1
or religion, among other categories. 
2
(6) Some young people experience a form of 
3
bullying called relational aggression or psychological 
4
bullying, which harms individuals by damaging, 
5
threatening, or manipulating their relationships with 
6
their peers, or by injuring their feelings of social ac-
7
ceptance. 
8
(7) Interventions to address bullying and har-
9
assment conduct to create a positive and safe school 
10
climate, combined with evidence-based discipline 
11
policies and practices, such as Positive Behavior 
12
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and restorative 
13
practices, can minimize suspensions, expulsions, and 
14
other exclusionary discipline policies to ensure that 
15
students are not ‘‘pushed-out’’ or diverted to the ju-
16
venile justice system. 
17
(8) According to one poll, 85 percent of Ameri-
18
cans strongly support or somewhat support a Fed-
19
eral law to require schools to enforce specific rules 
20
to prevent bullying. 
21
(9) Students, parents, educators, and policy-
22
makers have come together to call for leadership and 
23
action to address the national crisis of bullying and 
24
harassment.
