SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds that: 
4
(1) Federal regulation serves important goals 
5
and has achieved important objectives. The accumu-
6
lation of Federal regulations over the decades, how-
7
ever, is of concern. The Code of Federal Regulations 
8
currently contains over 180,000 pages of regula-
9
tions, many of which may be outdated, no longer 
10
needed, or duplicative. 
11
(2) Unneeded or inefficient regulation reduces 
12
the ability of United States employers and workers 
13
to generate and obtain more jobs and higher wages. 
14
It also increases the expenses of United States 
15
households and hinders the overall performance and 
16
competitiveness of the United States economy in the 
17
global marketplace. 
18
(3) Unneeded or inefficient regulation is par-
19
ticularly problematic as United States employers, 
20
workers, and households continue to respond to and

seek to recover from the Coronavirus SARS–CoV–2 
1
pandemic of 2019–2020. 
2
(4) A timely and prioritized review of existing 
3
regulations to identify those that can and should be 
4
modified, consolidated, harmonized, or repealed to 
5
promote higher jobs and wages, reduce household ex-
6
penses, and improve economic performance and com-
7
petitiveness in and by the United States is needed. 
8
(5) Such a review, moreover, is needed to accel-
9
erate and strengthen the recovery of United States 
10
employers, workers, and households from the 
11
Coronavirus SARS–CoV–2 pandemic and ensure 
12
that Federal regulations do not inhibit or impede 
13
preparedness for and effective responses to future 
14
pandemics. 
15
(6) The establishment of an expert commission, 
16
charged to conduct such a review and recommend to 
17
Congress legislation to effectuate a prioritized set of 
18
regulatory modifications, consolidations, harmoni-
19
zations, and repeals, can ensure that such a review 
20
will be completed in the timeliest possible way. 
21
(7) In light of the adverse impacts of and cir-
22
cumstances caused by the Coronavirus SARS–CoV– 
23
2 pandemic, it is particularly important that such a 
24
commission prioritize in its review the elimination of

the pandemic under the authority of Executive

Order 13924 (85 Fed. Reg. 31353; relating to 
12
regulatory relief to support economic recovery) 
13
or any other authority; 
14
(B) could impede preparedness for or re-
15

(C) otherwise impeded or could impede

health, economic performance, or the stability 
18
of wages or employment during the Coronavirus 
19
SARS–CoV–2 pandemic or a future pandemic, 
20
including those that were suspended or for
