RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress disapproves of the December 20 COVID–19 
vaccine distribution availability timeline guidance of the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advi-
sory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 
Whereas, on December 20, 2020, the CDC ACIP released up-
dated guidance to States regarding distribution of 
COVID–19 vaccines across the country; 
Whereas the CDC has consistently warned of serious health 
complications and high mortality rates amongst elder 
Americans over the age of 65 if they are infected with 
COVID–19;

•HRES 1272 IH 
Whereas statistics gathered throughout the COVID–19 pan-
demic cite a disturbing ratio of 79 percent of total re-
lated deaths being amongst elder Americans over the age 
of 65; 
Whereas CDC guidance outlines the first priority for 
COVID–19 vaccine distribution will go to high-risk health 
care professionals and residents of long-term care facili-
ties; 
Whereas CDC guidance recommends the second priority for 
COVID–19 vaccine delivery will be the simultaneous dis-
tribution to 30 million ‘‘Frontline Essential Workers’’ 
and 21 million Americans 75 years of age and older; 
Whereas the majority of ‘‘Frontline Essential Workers’’ are 
under the age of 65, and the CDC is therefore 
prioritizing young, healthy people ahead of elder Ameri-
cans between 65 to 74 years old, including those with un-
derlying health conditions; 
Whereas CDC guidance recommends the third priority for 
COVID–19 vaccine delivery will be the simultaneous dis-
tribution to 57 million ‘‘Essential Workers’’, 32 million 
elder Americans 65–74 years of age, and 110 million 
Americans 16–64 years of age with high-risk medical 
conditions; 
Whereas the majority of ‘‘Essential Workers’’ are under the 
age of 65, and the CDC is therefore placing these work-
ers at the same level of priority as vulnerable elder Amer-
icans 65–74 years old, including many with high-risk 
health complications; 
Whereas the current guidance allows 87 million ‘‘Essential 
Workers’’ to receive the vaccine at or before the same 
time as elder Americans 65 and older, and the CDC is

therefore prioritizing tens of millions of young, healthy 
workers to receive the vaccine ahead of those who are 
statistically far more likely to die upon contracting the 
disease, according to their own statistics; 
Whereas the CDC itself, as of August 18, 2020, reported ra-
tios of hospitalization for age groups compared to the 
base of 18–29-year-olds as the following: 
(1) 0–4 years, 4× lower, 
(2) 5–17 years, 9× lower, 
(3) 18–29 years, Comparison Group, 
(4) 30–39 years, 2× higher, 
(5) 40–49 years, 3× higher, 
(6) 50–64 years, 4× higher, 
(7) 65–74 years, 5× higher, 
(8) 75–84 years, 8× higher, 
(9) 85+ years, 13× higher; 
Whereas the CDC itself, as of August 18, 2020, reports ra-
tios of mortality for age groups compared to the base of 
18–29-year-olds as the following: 
(1) 0–4 years, 9× lower, 
(2) 5–17 years, 16× lower, 
(3) 18–29 years, Comparison Group, 
(4) 30–39 years, 4× higher, 
(5) 40–49 years, 10× higher, 
(6) 50–64 years, 30× higher, 
(7) 65–74 years, 90× higher, 
(8) 75–84 years, 220× higher, 
(9) 85+ years, 630× higher; 
Whereas it has been scientifically established that the COVID 
vaccines are highly effective in preventing vaccine recipi-
ents from developing severe or life-threatening symptoms; 
and

•HRES 1272 IH 
Whereas it has not yet been scientifically established that the 
vaccine is effective in preventing vaccine recipients from 
spreading the disease to others: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) disapproves of the December 20 COVID–19 
2
vaccine distribution availability timeline guidance of 
3
CDC ACIP prioritizing young, healthy workers 
4
above many aged 65 and older; and 
5
(2) encourages CDC ACIP to revise its

COVID–19 vaccine guidance to prioritize those aged

65 and older before providing the vaccine to those

younger than 65.
