RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Department of the Navy should take a leading role 
in the mitigation of cross-border spills, discharges, and 
debris in the Tijuana River that impact national security 
interests of the United States. 
Whereas runoff crossing the United States-Mexico border 
poses significant environmental and public health risks; 
Whereas discharges of raw sewage into the Tijuana River 
have required Navy in-water military training in the vi-
cinity of Coronado, California, to be shifted to other loca-
tions due to health and safety concerns;

Whereas the $1,000,000,000 Navy SEAL training center, 
Naval Base Coronado Coastal Campus, is located less 
than three miles from the mouth of the Tijuana River; 
Whereas sewage spills and debris, such as discarded tires, 
often clog the river channel, causing substantial erosion 
along the perimeter of the Naval Outlying Landing Field 
Imperial Beach (NOLFIB), which has threatened the in-
stallation’s perimeter fencing and resulted in the Navy 
developing a project to reinforce the riverbank and relo-
cate portions of Navy fencing; 
Whereas such discharges also cause secondary impacts to 
local Navy operations, such as beach closures at Naval 
Base Coronado in areas that are prime nesting grounds 
for the Western Snowy Plover and the California Least 
Tern; 
Whereas increased regulatory actions by State and Federal 
environmental protection agencies may be levied if the 
quality and safety of these species’ nesting areas are af-
fected, which will negatively constrain military activities 
in these areas; and 
Whereas Congress is concerned that future spills, discharges, 
and debris from the Tijuana River may have more sig-
nificant impacts on the military installations and oper-
ations in the San Diego region: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the Department of the Navy should take 
2
a leading role in the mitigation of cross-border spills, dis-
3
charges, and debris in the Tijuana River that impact na-
4
tional security interests of the United States.
