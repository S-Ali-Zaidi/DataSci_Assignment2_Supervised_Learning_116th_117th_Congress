Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives sup-
porting visits and communication between the United 
States and the Republic of Artsakh at all levels of civil 
society and government. 
Whereas peace, stability, and democracy in the Caucasus re-
gion are in the political, security, and economic interests 
of the United States and are matters of international 
concern; 
Whereas the United States considers any effort to determine 
the future of the Republic of Artsakh, formerly the Re-
public of Nagorno-Karabakh, by other than peaceful

means, including acts of aggression, blockades, or threats 
against civil aviation, a threat to peace; 
Whereas the United States remains committed to the Organi-
zation for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s (OSCE) 
Minsk Group negotiations toward a durable and demo-
cratic resolution of outstanding status and security issues 
related to the Artsakh Republic; 
Whereas the Artsakh Republic was one of three parties to the 
1994 cease-fire that ended major military hostilities be-
tween Artsakh and Azerbaijan, and remains committed to 
a negotiated, non-violent resolution; 
Whereas the Artsakh Republic took part in OSCE negotia-
tions until 1998, when, at Azerbaijan’s insistence, the 
OSCE blocked its democratically elected representatives 
from full and direct participation in negotiations regard-
ing its future status and security; 
Whereas the Artsakh Republic has developed democratic in-
stitutions, fostered a pluralist political system, and, over 
the past quarter century, held parliamentary and Presi-
dential elections that have been rated as free and fair by 
international observers; 
Whereas the Artsakh Republic, along with the United States, 
Armenia, and the OSCE, support cease-fire monitoring 
proposals to strengthen the 1994 cease-fire, including— 
(1) an agreement from all sides to not deploy snip-
ers, heavy arms, or new weaponry along the line of con-
tact; 
(2) the placement of OSCE-monitored, advanced 
gunfire-locator systems and sound-ranging equipment to 
determine the source of attacks along the line of contact; 
and

(3) the deployment of additional OSCE observers 
along the line of contact to better monitor the cease-fire; 
Whereas the United States since fiscal year 1998 has pro-
vided over $45 million to the victims of the Artsakh-Azer-
baijan conflict, including projects to deliver maternal 
healthcare, provide clean drinking water, and clear mine-
fields in Artsakh, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson 
stating that the United States remains ‘‘focused on com-
pleting demining as quickly and as thoroughly as pos-
sible’’; 
Whereas current Department of State policies and practices 
place self-imposed restrictions on travel and communica-
tions between the United States and Artsakh, limiting 
oversight of United States taxpayer-funded assistance 
programs and discouraging the open dialogue and dis-
course that can contribute to a peaceful resolution of 
Artsakh-related status and security issues; and 
Whereas open dialogue and communications contribute to 
greater international understanding and facilitate more 
effective conflict resolution: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) affirms its commitment to supporting ac-
2
tions that encourage visits and communication be-
3
tween officials from the United States and Artsakh

at all levels, including cabinet-level national security

officials, general officers, and other executive branch

officials, to travel to Artsakh and openly and directly
