P. ‘‘Buck’’ McKeon National Defense Authorization 
2
Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (16 U.S.C. 539p) author-
3
izes the approximately 2,422 acres of Forest Service 
4
land in the Tonto National Forest in southeastern 
5
Arizona commonly known as ‘‘Oak Flat’’ (referred 
6
to in this section as ‘‘Oak Flat’’), which is sacred to 
7
Indian Tribes in the region and is listed on the Na-
8
tional Register of Historic Places, to be transferred 
9
to Resolution Copper Mining, LLC, a Delaware lim-
10
ited liability company (referred to in this section as 
11
‘‘Resolution Copper’’); 
12
(2) Resolution Copper plans to hold Oak Flat 
13
privately for a mining project that will— 
14
(A) result in the physical destruction of 
15
Tribal sacred areas and deprive American Indi-
16
ans from practicing their religious ceremonies 
17
and other traditional practices; 
18
(B) create significant negative environ-
19
mental impacts by destroying Oak Flat and de-
20
pleting and contaminating precious water re-
21
sources; and 
22
(C) require significant quantities of water,

(i) likely affect the local hydrology, in-

cluding the underlying aquifer; and 
2
(ii) result in polluted water that will

seep into drinking water supplies; 
4
(3)(A) once Resolution Copper owns Oak Flat, 
5
Resolution Copper plans to use the highly destruc-
6
tive block cave mining method to remove 1 cubic 
7
mile of ore that (as of the date of enactment of this 
8
Act) is located 7,000 feet beneath the surface of the 
9
earth without replacing any of the earth removed, 
10
because that is the cheapest form of mining; and 
11
(B) Resolution Copper admits that the surface 
12
of Oak Flat will subside and ultimately collapse, de-
13
stroying forever the Tribal sacred area described in 
14
paragraph (2)(A); 
15
(4) the Tonto National Forest in which Oak 
16
Flat is located was established in 1905 from the an-
17
cestral homelands of American Indians, who were 
18
forcibly removed at gunpoint from Oak Flat and 
19
other areas of the Forest by the Army during the 
20
1880s and imprisoned as prisoners of war until the 
21
early 1900s;

(6)(A) Indian Tribes have— 
1
(i) ceded or had taken from the Tribes mil-
2
lions of acres of land to help build the United 
3
States; and 
4
(ii) suffered under Federal assimilationist 
5
policies that sought to destroy Tribal cultures; 
6
(B) despite those policies, American Indians 
7
continue to practice their religions as they have done 
8
for thousands of years; 
9
(C) American Indian places of worship, or sa-
10
cred areas, are often land-based, including moun-
11
tains, streams, and trees; and 
12
(D) as a result of previous Federal land policies 
13
that resulted in the significant loss of land of Indian 
14
Tribes, many sacred areas of the Tribes are cur-
15
rently located on Federal land; 
16
(7)(A) the United States has a trust responsi-
17
bility acknowledged by Congress to protect Tribal 
18
sacred areas on Federal land, including pursuant to 
19
laws requiring meaningful consultation with affected 
20
Indian Tribes before making decisions that will im-
21

6
Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (16 U.S.C. 539p)— 
7
(A) was strongly opposed by Indian Tribes 
8
throughout the United States because that sec-
9
tion establishes a dangerous legislative prece-
10
dent for the lack of protection of Tribal sacred 
11
areas located on Federal land by mandating the 
12
conveyance of Federal land with significant reli-
13
gious, cultural, historic, and anthropological 
14
significance for Indian Tribes to a private com-
15
pany that will destroy the land;

(B) circumvents standard environmental 
17
review procedures that ensure that the public 
18
interest is protected, including the interests of 
19
