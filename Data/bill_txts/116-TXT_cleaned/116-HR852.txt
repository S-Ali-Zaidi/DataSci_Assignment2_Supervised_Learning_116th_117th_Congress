RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the first Saturday 
of every January as ‘‘National FIRST Robotics Day’’. 
Whereas FIRST is For the Inspiration and Recognition of 
Science and Technology; 
Whereas robotics is rapidly proving to be one of the most ef-
fective, compelling, and engaging means for teaching and 
reinforcing fundamental science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics (STEM) concepts as well as inspiring 
the Nation’s youth to pursue STEM-related careers 
thereby helping to create a highly skilled, 21st century 
American workforce; 
Whereas there is a strong need to recognize America’s leader-
ship in robotics technology, educate the public on robotics 
technology’s broad potential, growing importance, and fu-
ture impact on American society, underscore the need for

increased investment in robotics technology research and 
development, and inspire the Nation’s youth to pursue 
careers in robotics and other STEM-related fields; 
Whereas the United States has the largest number of aca-
demic and research organizations with dedicated pro-
grams focused on the advancement of robotics tech-
nology; 
Whereas mathematics and science are a critical part of a 
child’s education; 
Whereas aptitude in mathematics, science, and engineering is 
essential for a knowledge-based society; 
Whereas the United States needs to reinforce mathematics 
and science education for all students in order to better 
prepare children for the future and to succeed in a 21st 
century economy; 
Whereas the National Science Foundation has been driving 
innovation in mathematics and science education at all 
levels from elementary through graduate education since 
its creation 68 years ago; 
Whereas robotics has matured into an all-encompassing and 
enabling technology that, as a pillar of 21st century 
American innovation, is positioned to fuel a broad array 
of next generation products and applications, and trans-
form society; 
Whereas the emerging market for service robotics in various 
sectors, including health care, national defense, homeland 
security, energy, manufacturing, logistics, transportation, 
agriculture, education, consumer goods, and others, is ex-
pected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 
nearly 20 percent over the next few years to become a 
worldwide $27,000,000,000 industry; and
