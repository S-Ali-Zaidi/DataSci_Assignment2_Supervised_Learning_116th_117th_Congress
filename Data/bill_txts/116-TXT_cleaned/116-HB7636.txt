•HR 7636 IH
(1) According to the National Conference of 
1
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, research 
2
has demonstrated that video recording of custodial 
3
interrogations furthers three important civic values: 
4
truth-finding, efficient and fair administration of 
5
justice, and protection of constitutional guarantees.

Crim. L. Rev. 1297 (2008). 
10
(2) Video recording of the entire process of cus-
11
todial interrogation has proven to be a major ad-
12
vance in law enforcement, improving the ability to 
13
solve crimes and prove cases while lowering the over-
14
all costs of investigation and litigation. 
15
(3) Video recording of custodial interrogations 
16
promotes truth-finding in several ways, including by 
17
reducing the incentive to fabricate, compensating for 
18
faulty or unreliable recollections of witnesses, deter-
19
ring problematic interrogation methods, filtering out 
20
weak cases, and enhancing the ability of finders of 
21
fact to assess witness credibility and veracity. 
22
(4) Video recording of custodial interrogations 
23
promotes efficiency in the administration of the 
24
criminal justice system by reducing the number of

frivolous suppression motions, improving the quality 
1
of police investigations, improving the quality of re-
2
view and case screening by prosecutors, and reduc-
3
ing the likelihood of hung juries. 
4
(5) Video recording of custodial interrogations 
5
safeguards constitutional rights and values by mak-
6
ing it easier for courts to adjudicate motions to sup-
7
press, by making it easier for prosecutors to pre-
8
serve and disclose material exculpatory evidence re-
9
quired under the Supreme Court decision in Brady 
10
v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), by making it easi-
11
er for superiors to train police officers in how to 
12
comply with constitutional mandates and for the 
13
press, and by making it easier for the press, the ju-
14
diciary, prosecutors, independent watchdog groups, 
15
and police administrators to identify and correct 
16
misuses of power by law enforcement. 
17
(6) Video recordings of custodial interrogations 
18
make it easier to identify and avoid biases, which 
19
would otherwise be difficult to detect and correct be-
20
cause such biases are often unconscious, thus oper-
21
ating outside police awareness. 
22
(7) Video recordings of custodial interrogations 
23
help to improve public confidence in the fairness and 
24
professionalism of policing, which in a democracy

not only is a good in itself but also a proven means 
1
of reducing crime and enhancing citizen cooperation 
2
in solving crimes. 
3
(8) Video recording of the entire process of cus-
4
todial interrogation is likely to be a major boon to 
5
law enforcement, improving its ability to prove its 
6
cases while lowering overall costs of investigation 
7
and litigation. Such recording will also, however, im-
8
prove systemic accuracy, fairness to the accused and 
9
the State alike, protection of constitutional rights, 
10
and public confidence in the justice system.
