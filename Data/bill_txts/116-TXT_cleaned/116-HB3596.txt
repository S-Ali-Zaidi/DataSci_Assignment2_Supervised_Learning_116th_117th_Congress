‘‘(a) FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.—

‘‘(1) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
3
lowing: 
4
‘‘(A) Water-dependent commercial activi-
5
ties are the economic and cultural heart of 
6
many coastal communities. These activities in-
7
clude commercial fishing, recreational fishing 
8
businesses, aquaculture, boatbuilding, transpor-
9
tation, and many other water-dependent busi-
10
nesses. 
11
‘‘(B) Water-dependent commercial activi-
12
ties depend on coastal access in the form of— 
13
‘‘(i) docks, wharfs, boat lifts, wet and 
14
dry marinas, and boat ramps; 
15
‘‘(ii) boat hauling, repair, and con-
16
struction facilities; 
17
‘‘(iii) commercial fishing facilities; and 
18
‘‘(iv) other support structures on, 
19
over, or adjacent to navigable bodies of 
20
water. 
21
‘‘(C) The coastal zone of the United States 
22
is experiencing rising property values and taxes, 
23
and related development pressure, as more peo-
24
ple move to the coastal zone and as coastal

1
wealthier individuals. 
2
‘‘(D) The coastal zone is facing numerous 
3
challenges due to extreme weather events, sea 
4
level rise, and other changes. 
5
‘‘(E) Privately owned access areas for 
6
water-dependent commercial activity in many 
7
States are under increasing threat from private 
8
residential development and other conversion. 
9
Such development and investment is often not 
10
conducted in ways that accounts for resilience. 
11
‘‘(F) Loss of access for water-dependent 
12
commercial activity would have economically 
13
and culturally devastating consequences for 
14
many coastal communities. 
15
‘‘(2) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this section is 
16
to preserve and protect coastal access for persons 
17
engaged in water-dependent commercial activities, 
18
including commercial fishing, recreational fishing 
19
businesses, aquaculture, boatbuilding, or other 
20
water-dependent coastal-related businesses.
