1
validation according to the requirements outlined in the

Computational Forensic Algorithm Standards and make 
3
the results publicly available. The internal validation shall

6
rensic Algorithm Testing Program. 
7
(d) REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING.—The Director of 
8
the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall 
9
establish a Computational Forensic Algorithm Testing 
10
Program, whose activities include the following: 
11
(1) Testing individual software programs using 
12
the testing requirements established in the Computa-
13
tional Forensic Algorithm Standards. 
14
(2) Using realistic sample testing data similar 
15
to what would be used by law enforcement in crimi-
16
nal investigations in performing such testing, includ-
17
ing incomplete and contaminated samples. 
18
(3) Using testing data that represents diversity 
19
of racial, ethnic, and gender identities and intersec-
20
tions of these identities in performing such testing. 
21
(4) Using testing data that tests the limits of 
22
the software and demonstrates the boundaries of re-
23
liability described in the performance measures de-
