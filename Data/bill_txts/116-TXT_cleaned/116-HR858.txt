RESOLUTION 
Condemning Stephen Miller for his trafficking in bigotry, 
hatred, and divisive political rhetoric and policies that 
are inconsistent with the trust and confidence placed 
in him as a Senior Advisor to the President and express-
ing the sense of the House of Representatives that he 
should immediately resign from office. 
Whereas Public Law 115–58, a joint resolution signed into 
law on September 14, 2017, rejects ‘‘white nationalism, 
white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and 
other hate groups’’;

Whereas, on January 15, 2019, the House of Representatives 
passed a resolution ‘‘reject[ing] White nationalism and 
White supremacy as hateful expressions of intolerance 
that are contradictory to the values that define the people 
of the United States’’; 
Whereas White supremacy and White nationalism are con-
trary to the ideals of the United States of America, which 
has long embraced inclusive patriotism and welcomed im-
migrants from across the globe, enriching our Nation; 
Whereas Stephen Miller has long cultivated relationships and 
correspondence with those who follow White nationalist 
ideologies; 
Whereas recently published emails of Stephen Miller pri-
marily concern the subjects of race and immigration, ex-
clusively focus on offenses committed by non-Whites, and 
promote policies to severely limit or end non-White immi-
gration to the United States; 
Whereas, in his emails, Stephen Miller directly and repeatedly 
suggested story ideas to the website Breitbart, pushing 
Breitbart’s news coverage to reference White suprema-
cist, racist, and eugenic ideologies; 
Whereas a former Breibart editor has acknowledged Stephen 
Miller’s suggestions were used to ‘‘spin a narrative where 
immigrants of color were not only dangerous, violent indi-
viduals but also posed an existential threat to America’’; 
Whereas eugenics is a set of racist beliefs—embraced by 
Adolf Hitler—that the human population can be im-
proved by promoting genetic groups deemed to be ‘‘supe-
rior’’ and eliminating or excluding genetic groups deemed 
to be ‘‘inferior’’;

Whereas, in his emails, Stephen Miller repeatedly rec-
ommended that Brietbart write articles supporting Calvin 
Coolidge and the Immigration Act of 1924, a law based 
on eugenic ideology that created a ‘‘national origin’’ 
quota system aimed at restricting immigration to the 
United States from areas other than Northern and West-
ern Europe; 
Whereas the Immigration Act of 1924 prohibited all immigra-
tion from Asia, severely restricted immigration from Afri-
ca, and used outdated census data to exclude many other 
people who were deemed by some as ‘‘inferior’’ or ‘‘unde-
sirable’’, including immigrants from Southern and East-
ern Europe; 
Whereas the Immigration Act of 1924 was strongly sup-
ported at the time by eugenicists and reflected the perva-
siveness of anti-immigrant and nativist sentiment at the 
time; 
Whereas President Coolidge once wrote that, ‘‘Our country 
must cease to be regarded as a dumping ground [for new 
immigrants] . . . Biological laws tell us that certain diver-
gent people will not mix or blend’’; 
Whereas the Immigration Act of 1924 was the same law that 
Adolf Hitler described as a model for Nazi Germany in 
‘‘Mein Kampf’’ to help make his eugenic ideology a re-
ality; 
Whereas the Immigration Act of 1924 controlled American 
immigration policy until the passage of the Immigration 
and Naturalization Act of 1965, which abandoned eu-
genic ideology and eliminated the ‘‘national origin’’ quota 
system;

Whereas Stephen Miller is now widely understood to direct 
immigration policy for the Trump administration, includ-
ing support for legislative and administrative proposals 
that would severely reduce immigration to the United 
States; and 
Whereas Stephen Miller’s leadership position brings discredit 
upon the White House: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) the House of Representatives does hereby 
2
condemn Stephen Miller for his trafficking in big-
3
otry, hatred, and divisive political rhetoric and poli-
4
cies that are inconsistent with the trust and con-
5
fidence placed in him as a Senior Advisor to the 
6
President; and 
7
(2) it is the sense of the House of Representa-
8
tives that Stephen Miller, Senior Advisor to the 
9
President, should immediately resign from office, 
10
and if he does not resign, the President should re-
11
move him from office.
