wrote in the final rule titled ‘‘Endangered and

Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Rule To Re-
6
classify and Remove the Gray Wolf From the List 
7
of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in Portions 
8
of the Conterminous United States; Establishment 
9
of Two Special Regulations for Threatened Gray 
10
Wolves’’ (68 Fed. Reg. 15803; April 1, 2003) that 
11
‘‘[e]stablishing additional populations would provide 
12
no additional genetic benefits to wolf recovery under 
13
the Act. . .’’ and ‘‘new recovery programs are not 
14
necessary to achieve recovery of the gray wolf under 
15
the Act either as formerly listed in the 48 States 
16
and Mexico or under the new listings established by 
17
this final rule’’.

tinct population segment of the gray wolf in the 
3
Northern Rocky Mountains of the United States and 
4
revises the List of Endangered and Threatened

Wildlife by removing gray wolves within the North-

ern Rocky Mountain distinct population segment

(4) Under President Obama, the United States 
9
Fish and Wildlife Service published a final rule on 
10
September 10, 2012 (77 Fed. Reg. 55530), that was 
11
reinstated on March 3, 2017, by the decision of the 
12
United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
13
Columbia (No. 14–5300), and further republished on 
14
May 1, 2017 (82 Fed. Reg. 20284), which states 
15
that the best scientific and commercial data avail-
16
able indicate that gray wolves in Wyoming have re-
