(2) Since 1949, the close relationship between 
1
the United States and Taiwan has benefitted both 
2
parties and the broader Indo-Pacific region. 
3
(3) The security of Taiwan and its democracy 
4
are key elements of continued peace and stability of 
5
the greater Indo-Pacific region, which is in the polit-
6
ical, security, and economic interests of the United 
7
States. 
8
(4) The People’s Republic of China is currently 
9
engaged in a comprehensive military modernization 
10
campaign to enhance the power-projection capabili-
11
ties of the People’s Liberation Army and its ability 
12
to conduct joint operations, which is shifting the 
13
military balance of power across the Taiwan Strait. 
14
(5) Taiwan and its diplomatic partners continue 
15
to face sustained pressure and coercion from the 
16
People’s Republic of China, which seeks to isolate 
17
Taiwan from the international community. 
18
(6) It is the policy of the United States to rein-
19
force its commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan 
20
Relations Act in a manner consistent with the ‘‘Six 
21
Assurances’’ and in accordance with the United 
22
States ‘‘One China’’ policy. 
23
(7) In the Taiwan Travel Act, which became 
24
law on March 16, 2018, Congress observed that the

15
sales and transfers of defense articles to Taiwan in

17
ticularly its efforts to develop and integrate asym-
18
metric capabilities, including undersea warfare and
