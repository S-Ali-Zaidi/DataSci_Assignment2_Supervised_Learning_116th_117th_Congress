A BILL 
To prohibit implementation of a rule defining ‘‘waters of 
the United States’’ under the Federal Water Pollution 
Control Act, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

integrity of the Nation’s waters’’, as enacted 
1
through the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
2
Amendments of 1972, more commonly known as the 
3
Clean Water Act, by a 10-to-1 margin over the veto 
4
of President Richard M. Nixon; 
5
(2) overturn the Trump administration’s Dirty 
6
Water Rule, which eliminates Clean Water Act pro-
7
tections for countless rivers, streams, lakes, and wet-
8
lands that have been protected by the Clean Water 
9
Act for decades under regulations established by the 
10
Corps of Engineers under the Reagan administra-
11
tion in 1986, and implemented by Republican and 
12
Democratic administrations alike; and 
13
(3) restore bipartisan Clean Water Act protec-
14
tions over the Nation’s network of streams, lakes, 
15
rivers, and wetlands that are necessary for sus-
16
taining life, are critical to the economic and environ-
17
mental health of the Nation, and are essential for 
18
the well-being of farmers, small businesses, commu-
19
nities, and the Nation’s way of life.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
21
Congress finds the following: 
22
(1) Access to clean water is a fundamental 
23
right; it is necessary to sustain life and the economic 
24

•HR 6745 IH
and environmental health and well-being of cities, 
1
towns, and communities. 
2
(2) Americans rely on the Nation’s network of 
3
streams and rivers, and the bodies of water into 
4
which they flow, for human and environmental 
5
health, as well as the economic health of cities, 
6
towns, and communities. 
7
(3) This network of streams and rivers, includ-
8
ing the intermittent and ephemeral streams that 
9
constitute more than two-thirds of all streams in the 
10
conterminous United States, feed the public drinking 
11
water systems of approximately 117 million Ameri-
12
cans. 
13
(4) The Environmental Protection Agency’s 
14
own comprehensive review of peer-reviewed scientific 
15
publications stated that ‘‘the scientific literature un-
16
equivocally demonstrates that streams, individually 
17
or cumulatively, exert a strong influence on the in-
18
tegrity of downstream waters’’ and that the connec-
19
tions between streams and downstream waters are 
20
critical to the health of downstream waters, includ-
21
ing where the upstream waters serve as the primary 
22
source of water for the downstream waters, and the 
23
myriad other chemical, physical, and biological con-
24
nections. 
25

(5) Americans also rely on wetlands, including 
1
non-floodplain wetlands, to capture and store excess 
2
water, nutrients, and materials from stormwater or 
3
runoff, preventing or reducing pollution to down-
4
stream waters, and lessening the potential for down-
5
stream flooding. 
6
(6) There is overwhelming scientific evidence, 
7
which has been reviewed and confirmed by the Envi-
8
ronmental Protection Agency’s Science Advisory 
9
Board, that there are no streams or rivers safe to 
10
pollute or degrade, and that wetlands, both individ-
11
ually and cumulatively, have a direct and consequen-
12
tial impact on the quality of downstream waters and 
13
on the health and safety of downstream commu-
14
nities. 
15
(7) Restoring the protection of the network of 
16
streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands, and other 
17
waters of the United States, is necessary to restore 
18
and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological 
19
integrity of all waters in the United States. 
20
(8) Recent events demonstrate how increased 
21
pollution in and degradation of streams, rivers, 
22
lakes, and wetlands, and other waters of the United 
23
States, can cause catastrophic harm to communities’ 
24
health and economic strength, such as—

(A) the 2014 harmful algal bloom in west-
1

2
shutdown of the drinking water supply of To-
3

4

5
(B) the 2014 chemical spill into the Elk

15
(D) recent flooding events, including along

and in communities, such as Houston, Texas,

demonstrate how destruction of critical wet-

lands and degradation of watersheds can exac-
20
erbate the severity and duration of flood events

and increase the financial impacts to local com-

(E) worsening drought conditions and fre-

quency have highlighted the importance of

source water protection, reclamation, and recy-
3
cling to ensure communities, farmers, and small 
4
businesses have sufficient quantities and quality 
5
of water resources for current and future needs. 
6
(9) Congress has recently recognized the impor-
7
tance of comprehensive approaches to protect critical 
8
waterbodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay, the Great 
9
Lakes, Lake Pontchartrain, the Long Island Sound, 
10
the Puget Sound, and the San Francisco Bay, and 
11
national estuaries, which depend on protection of the 
12
entire watersheds of these waterbodies to reduce lev-
13
els of pollution and prevent further degradation of 
14
rivers, streams, and wetlands that feed and maintain 
15
these critical waterbodies. 
16
(10) Despite the overwhelming, bipartisan sup-
17
port for clean water and the overwhelming scientific 
18
evidence on the interconnectivity of rivers, streams, 
19
lakes, wetlands, and other waters of the United 
20
States, following calls by corporate polluters to 
21
weaken the Clean Water Act, the Trump administra-
22
tion finalized its Dirty Water Rule, also known as 
23
the ‘‘Navigable Waters Protection Rule’’, to radically

•HR 6745 IH
narrow decades-old regulations established by Presi-
1
dent Ronald Reagan. 
2
(11) According to Environmental Protection 
3
Agency documents, the Trump administration’s 
4
Dirty Water Rule would— 
5
(A) eliminate Clean Water Act protections 
6
on between 18 to 71 percent of the Nation’s 
7
stream and river miles that were protected 
8
under the Reagan-era regulations; 
9
(B) eliminate Federal protections on over 
10
half of the Nation’s wetlands in the continental 
11
United States that were protected under the 
12
Reagan-era regulations; and 
13
(C) result in approximately 16,000 existing 
14
Clean Water Act permitted facilities (including 
15
industrial facilities and sewage treatment sys-
16
tems) that may be allowed to discharge pollut-
17
ants without Federal oversight under the Clean 
18
Water Act. 
19
(12) In addition to the adverse human and en-
20
vironmental health impacts of the Trump adminis-
21
tration’s Dirty Water Rule, this effort will also have 
22
lasting adverse economic impacts on American fami-
23
lies, on farmers and other small businesses, and on 
24
the national, regional, and local economies.

(13) Additionally, America’s wildlife-watching, 
1
hunting, fishing, and $887 billion outdoor recreation 
2
economy all depend upon access to clean water. 
3
(14) In some rural communities, river recre-
4
ation, hunting, fishing, and related activities gen-
5
erate the largest share of the local economy; the 
6
streams and wetlands that will lose Federal protec-
7
tions under this rule include waters that provide es-
8
sential aquatic habitat for the fish, waterfowl, and 
9
wildlife that sustain this way of life. 
10
(15) The Trump administration’s own docu-
11
ment entitled ‘‘Economic Analysis for the Navigable 
12
Waters Protection Rule: Definition of ‘Waters of the 
13
United States’ ’’, dated January 22, 2020, recog-
14
nizes the potential adverse impacts of its Dirty 
15
Water Rule on local economies, individual house-
16
holds, and public health, including— 
17
(A) an increase in the discharge of pollut-
18
ants from point sources to newly unprotected 
19
rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands, including 
20
‘‘reduced protection for aquatic ecosystems and 
21
public health and welfare’’; 
22

23

that will adversely affect the environment, will 
1
increase the costs of drinking water treatment 
2
and reservoir maintenance, and will negatively 
3
affect recreational opportunities for downstream 
4
waters, such as fishing and swimming; 
5
(C) a ‘‘loss of wetlands and streams with-
6
out corresponding mitigation’’; 
7
(D) an increased risk for communities 
8
from flooding, both in terms of the magnitude 
9
of potential floods as well as the duration of 
10
flooding events; and 
11
(E) an increased risk in the frequency and 
12
duration of oil and chemical spills and the ad-
13
verse consequences of such spills on human and 
14
environmental health and local communities. 
15
(16) Despite recognizing the potential adverse 
16
impacts of the Trump administration’s Dirty Water 
17
Rule on local economies, individual households, and 
18
the public health, the Trump administration has re-
19
peatedly refused to quantify these impacts to Con-
20
gress and the American people. 
21
(17) With many communities living with unsafe 
22
waters and increased risks from extreme weather, 
23
flooding, and drought, now is not the time to cut 
24
back on the protection of clean water, as would
