A BILL 
To facilitate the development of affordable housing, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Housing is Infrastruc-
4
ture Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Affordable housing is a critical part of the 
8
national infrastructure of the United States but 
9
there is a severe shortage of affordable housing in 
10

the United States and the existing stock is badly in 
1
need of repair. 
2
(2) According to a 2010 study sponsored by the 
3
Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
4
there was a $26 billion backlog of capital needs for 
5
public housing; that figure is likely higher today, 
6
with some groups estimating the backlog of capital 
7
needs for public housing to be as high as $70 billion. 
8
(3) There are 14,000 units supported by Rural 
9
Rental Housing Loans under section 515 of the 
10
Housing Act of 1949 and Farm Labor Housing 
11
Loans under section 514 of the Housing Act of 
12
1949 that have an estimated unmet reserve need of 
13
$5,600,000,000 according to the latest estimate 
14
from the Department of Agriculture. 
15
(4) Federal investment in housing helps to cre-
16
ate jobs and stimulate the economy. 
17
(5) When the American Recovery and Reinvest-
18
ment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111–5) was enacted, 
19
which included funding for public housing, research-
20
ers found that for each $1.00 in direct spending on 
21
public housing, there was an additional $2.12 of in-
22
direct and induced economic activity nationwide for 
23
a total economic impact of $3.12 for each $1.00 in 
24
direct spending on public housing.

(6) According to the National Association of 
1
Home Builders, building 100 affordable rental 
2
homes generates $11.7 million in local income, 
3
$2,200,000 in taxes and revenue for local govern-
4
ments, and 161 local jobs. 
5
(7) Researchers estimate that the growth in the 
6
gross domestic product from 1964–2009 would have 
7
been 13.5 percent higher if families had better ac-
8
cess to affordable housing, which in turn could have 
9
led to an additional $1.7 trillion increase in income, 
10
equivalent to $8,775 in additional wages for each 
11
worker.
