Congress finds the following:

•HR 4836 IH
(1) Gun violence is a significant public health 
1
and safety concern nationwide and is a leading cause 
2
of death for people in the United States of nearly all 
3
ages. 
4
(2) From 2012 to 2017, over 105,000 people in 
5
the United States were murdered. Nearly 3⁄4 of these 
6
victims were murdered with a gun. Hundreds of 
7
thousands more were hospitalized or treated in 
8
emergency departments after surviving life-changing 
9
gunshot injuries. 
10
(3) Gun violence has sharply increased in the 
11
United States in recent years. Gun homicide rates 
12
spiked by 30 percent between 2014 and 2017, driven 
13
by large spikes in violence in some cities in the 
14
United States. 
15
(4) Shootings, homicides, and group-related vio-
16
lence are disproportionately concentrated in the 
17
poorest and most segregated urban areas of the Na-
18
tion, and have an enormously disproportionate im-
19
pact on young people of color in particular. From 
20
2012 to 2017, African-American children and teens 
21
were 14 times as likely to be shot to death as their 
22
White peers. Hispanic children and teens and Native 
23
American children and teens were both nearly 3 
24

•HR 4836 IH
times as likely to be shot to death as their White 
1
peers. 
2
(5) African-American men make up just 6 per-
3
cent of the population in the United States, but ac-
4
count for more than 50 percent of all gun homicide 
5
victims each year. 
6
(6) Violence is responsible for half of all deaths 
7
among young African-American men, ages 15 
8
through 24, as many as every other cause of death 
9
combined. 
10
(7) This violence imposes enormous human, so-
11
cial, and economic costs. Nationwide, the annual so-
12
cietal cost of firearm violence was estimated at 
13
$229,000,000,000 per year in 2012. Economists es-
14
timate that each firearm homicide generates hun-
15
dreds of thousands of dollars in direct public costs, 
16
including medical care and criminal justice expenses. 
17
(8) Several evidence-based violence intervention 
18
strategies have demonstrated remarkable success at 
19
interrupting entrenched cycles of violence, victimiza-
20
tion, and retaliation. These strategies reflect the im-
21
portant fact that in most cities, the vast majority of 
22
violence is perpetrated by a relatively small number 
23
of identifiable groups or individuals that comprise 
24
less than 0.5 percent of the city’s total population. 
25

•HR 4836 IH
(9) When properly implemented and consist-
1
ently funded, coordinated, evidence-based strategies 
2
focused on interrupting cycles of violence among in-
3
dividuals at highest risk can produce life-saving and 
4
cost-saving results in a short period of time without 
5
contributing to mass incarceration. Multiple cities 
6
have substantially reduced community violence in re-
7
cent years by implementing such strategies, includ-
8
ing the following: 
9
(A) Hospital-based violence intervention 
10
programs (referred to in this section as 
11
‘‘HVIP’’), which work to break cycles of vio-
12
lence by providing intensive counseling, peer 
13
support, case management, mediation, and so-
14
cial services to patients recovering from gunshot 
15
wounds and other violent injuries. Research has 
16
shown that violently injured patients are at 
17
high risk of retaliating with violence themselves 
18
and being revictimized by violence in the near 
19
future. Evaluations of HVIPs have found that 
20
patients who received HVIP services were 4 
21
times less likely to be convicted of a violent 
22
crime and roughly 4 times less likely to be sub-
23
sequently reinjured by violence than patients 
24
who did not receive HVIP services.

•HR 4836 IH
(B) Evidence-based street outreach pro-
1
grams, which treat gun violence as a commu-
2
nicable disease and work to interrupt its trans-
3
mission among community members. These 
4
public health-centered initiatives use street out-
5
reach workers to build relationships with high- 
6
risk individuals in their communities and con-
7
nect them with intensive counseling, mediation, 
8
peer support, and social services in order to re-
9
duce their risk of violence. Evaluations have 
10
found that these programs are associated with 
11
significant reductions in gun violence, with 
12
some sites reporting up to 70-percent reduc-
13
tions in homicides or assaults. 
14
(C) Strategies, including group violence 
15
interventions (referred to in this section as 
16
‘‘GVI’’), which are a form of problem-oriented 
17
policing that provides targeted social services 
18
and support to individuals at highest risk for 
19
involvement in community violence, and a proc-
20
ess for community members to voice a clear de-
21
mand for the violence to stop. This approach 
22
coordinates law enforcement, service providers, 
23
and community engagement efforts to reduce 
24
violence among a small, identifiable segment of 
25
22:24 Oct 29, 2019
H4836

•HR 4836 IH
the population that is responsible for the vast 
1
majority of gun violence in most cities. In one 
2
evaluation of the GVI program in Boston, re-
3
searchers found a 63-percent reduction in youth 
4
homicides and a 25-percent decline in monthly 
5
gun assaults across the city. Other studies have 
6
found that GVI programs were associated with 
7
homicide reductions of up to 60 percent. 
8
(10) These strategies are often most effective 
9
when local officials and dedicated staff work to co-
10
ordinate stakeholders, relevant public agencies, and 
11
service providers. Mayors in cities like Los Angeles 
12
and New York have established city departments 
13
that are primarily dedicated to violence prevention, 
14
and their offices have played a critical role in ensur-
15
ing cross-agency collaboration and information-shar-
16
ing. 
17
(11) These strategies are also most effective 
18
when they receive consistent funding. For example, 
19
large cuts in funding for violence prevention pro-
20
grams in Chicago in 2008, 2012, and 2015 through 
21
2016 corresponded with large spikes in homicides in 
22
those years. Similarly, the city of Stockton, Cali-
23
fornia, saw an increase in homicides after dis-
24
continuing funding for its highly successful GVI pro-
25
22:24 Oct 29, 2019
H4836

•HR 4836 IH
gram. When Stockton’s funding was restored, homi-
1
cides decreased. 
2
(12) A national strategy for reducing gun vio-
3
lence must include substantial and targeted Federal 
4
funding to expand and replicate the most effective 
5
strategies in communities most impacted by violence. 
6
(13) At present, however, these strategies are 
7
implemented in only a handful of cities and are 
8
funded through an unreliable patchwork of discre-
9
tionary grant programs. The current level of Federal 
10
funding to support the scaling of these strategies is 
11
woefully inadequate. 
12
(14) Intentional and sustained investments in 
13
evidence-based violence reduction strategies can re-
14
verse recent crime trends, help to heal impacted 
15
communities, and reduce the enormous human and 
16
financial costs of violence, without contributing to 
17
mass incarceration.
