21

the covered drug pursuant to subsection (c);

cation holder’s response, the Secretary shall prompt-
11
ly review each statement received under subsection 
12
(e)(2) and determine which labeling changes pursu-
13

warranted, the Secretary shall provide opportunity 
17
for discussions with the application holders to reach 
18
agreement on whether the labeling for the covered 
19
drug should be updated to reflect available scientific

evidence, and if so, the content of such labeling 
21
changes.

23

2
ing changes the Secretary determines are appro-

adding or modifying information or providing sup-
5
plemental information to such labeling. Such holder

of an approved application shall—

such generic version of the selected drug shall be deemed 
18
to be misbranded under section 502.

23
of use and the same labeling as a reference drug for 
24
purposes

of

505(j)(2)(A). Any labeling change so required shall 
1
not have any legal effect for the applicant that is 
2
different than the legal effect that would have re-
3
sulted if a supplemental application had been sub-
4
mitted and approved to conform the labeling of the 
5
generic version to a change in the labeling of the ref-
6
erence drug.

‘‘(2) SUPPLEMENTAL APPLICATIONS.—Changes 
8
to labeling made in accordance with this section

‘‘(1) APPROVAL
STANDARDS.—This section 
13
shall not be construed as altering the applicability of 
14
the standards for approval of an application under

applicable to any change to labeling under section 
19
505.

section shall be construed to limit the authority of
