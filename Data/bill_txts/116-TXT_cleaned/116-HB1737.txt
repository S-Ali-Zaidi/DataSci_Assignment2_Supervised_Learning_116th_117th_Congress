NEGLIGENCE

SEC. 201. DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) For generations, buying a home has been 
10
the primary way working families build wealth. 
11
(2) A home is not only a place to live, but also 
12
an asset that may appreciate, help fund a new busi-
13
ness, finance an education, or cover retirement ex-
14
penses. A home provides stability and financial pre-
15
dictability, which are important foundations for 
16
prosperity and access to opportunity for a family. 
17
(3) For decades, the Federal Government sub-
18
sidized homeownership—for White families. Until 
19
the 1960s, the Federal Government systematically 
20
denied African Americans and other marginalized 
21
groups the ability to obtain mortgage credit, buy 
22
homes, and build wealth for their families while sub-
23
sidizing the American dream for White families. 
24
00:00 Mar 27, 2019
H1737
34 
•HR 1737 IH
(4) The Federal Government, through the 
1
Home Owners’ Loan Corporation and the Federal 
2
Housing Administration, standardized and institu-
3
tionalized discriminatory policies on the basis of 
4
race, national origin, and religion that reflected 
5
practices in the private sector and became a model 
6
for their widespread adoption across the housing in-
7
dustry. 
8
(5) Racist restrictive covenants and zoning ordi-
9
nances also robbed families of color of the oppor-
10
tunity to live and build opportunity for their families 
11
in the community of their choice. 
12
(6) In the years before the 2008 financial crisis, 
13
lenders targeted borrowers of color with abusive 
14
loans while government regulators sat on their 
15
hands, further extracting wealth from these same 
16
communities. 
17
(7) The legacy of housing discrimination and 
18
regulatory negligence is a contributor to a large and 
19
growing gap in wealth and outcomes between Black 
20
and White families. The median income White fam-
21
ily in the United States has almost 10 times the 
22
wealth of the median income Black family in the 
23
United States. The gap between the White home-
24
ownership rate and the Black homeownership rate is 
25
00:00 Mar 27, 2019
H1737
35 
•HR 1737 IH
bigger today than it was when housing discrimina-
1
tion was legal. Seventy-five percent of formerly red-
2
lined communities are still low-income and 66 per-
3
cent are still minority communities. 
4
(8) The purpose of this section is for the Fed-
5
eral Government to take the first step toward ad-
6
dressing the racial wealth gap that it contributed to 
7
creating by helping individuals or descendants of in-
8
dividuals who were harmed by housing discrimina-
9
tion or negligence by the Federal Government.

17

(C)(i) resided in that geographic area dur-
