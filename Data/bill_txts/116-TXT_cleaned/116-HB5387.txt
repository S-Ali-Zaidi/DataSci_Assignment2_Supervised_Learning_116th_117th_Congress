SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The statement by President Recep Tayyip 
8

9
‘‘cannot accept’’ a state of affairs in which Turkey

has no missiles armed with nuclear warheads follows 
1
other concerning statements from senior officials 
2
that the Government of Turkey may pursue a nu-
3
clear-weapons capability, which runs counter to its 
4
obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
5
Treaty and the bipartisan United States objective of 
6
negotiating a weapons of mass destruction-free zone 
7
in the Middle East. 
8
(2) A United States civilian nuclear cooperation 
9
agreement with Turkey, signed in 2008 and up for 
10
automatic renewal in 2023, does not currently have 
11
to be submitted for congressional review, denying 
12
Congress the opportunity to insist upon a renewed 
13
agreement—a prohibition on Turkey’s enrichment of 
14
uranium or reprocessing of plutonium on its own 
15
territory in keeping with the strongest possible non-
16
proliferation ‘‘gold standard’’.
