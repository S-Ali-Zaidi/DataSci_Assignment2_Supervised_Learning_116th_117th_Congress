SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds that following: 
2
(1) In December 1921, the Peace silver dollar 
3
was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, 
4
replacing the Morgan silver dollar and commemo-
5
rating the declaration of peace between the United 
6
States and the Imperial German government. 
7
(2) The Peace silver dollar was minted in Phila-
8
delphia, Denver and San Francisco. The Morgan sil-
9
ver dollar was minted at Philadelphia, Denver, San 
10
Francisco, Carson City, and New Orleans. 
11
(3) The Peace silver dollar was designed by An-
12
thony de Francisci with the Goddess of Liberty on 
13
the obverse and a bald eagle clutching the olive 
14
branch (a symbol of peace) on the reverse. The 
15
Peace silver dollars were minted between 1921 to 
16
1935. 
17
(4) The Morgan silver dollar was designed by 
18
George T. Morgan and was minted from 1878 to 
19
1904, and again in 1921. The obverse depicts a pro-
20
file portrait of Lady Liberty and on the reverse, a 
21
heraldic eagle. 
22
(5) The conversion from the Morgan silver dol-
23
lar to the Peace silver dollar design in 1921 reflected 
24
a pivotal moment in American history. The Morgan 
25
silver dollar represents the country’s westward ex-

pansion and industrial development in the late 19th 
1
century. The Peace silver dollar symbolizes the coun-
2
try’s coming of age as an international power while 
3
recognizing the sacrifices made by her citizens in 
4
World War I and celebrating the victory and peace 
5
that ensued. 
6
(6) These iconic silver dollars with vastly dif-
7
ferent representations of Lady Liberty and the 
8
American Eagle, reflect a changing of the guard in 
9
1921 in the United States and therefore on the 
10
100th anniversary must begin to be minted again to 
11
commemorate this significant evolution of American 
12
freedom.
