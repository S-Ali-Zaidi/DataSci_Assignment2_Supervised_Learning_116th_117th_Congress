A BILL 
To amend the America COMPETES Act to improve meas-
urement and assessment capabilities for understanding 
proposed atmospheric interventions in Earth’s climate, 
including, as a priority, the effects of proposed interven-
tions in the stratosphere and in cloud-aerosol processes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Atmospheric Climate 
4
Intervention Research Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 5519 IH
(1) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
1
ministration (referred to in this section as ‘‘NOAA’’) 
2
and its Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research 
3
undertakes research, including scientific research, 
4
computer modeling and other forms of analysis, and 
5
uses satellite, airborne, and ground-based systems to 
6
monitor atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, in-
7
cluding radiative forcing gases and stratospheric 
8
ozone as well as the chemical compounds and atmos-
9
pheric conditions that affect its concentration. 
10
(2) The NOAA Earth System Research Labora-
11
tory, the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab-
12
oratory, and the NOAA Air Resource Laboratory are 
13
actively involved in observations, modeling, and mon-
14
itoring that enhance the scientific understanding of 
15
atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, drivers of ra-
16
diative forcing of climate change in the atmosphere, 
17
the health of the stratosphere, including ozone and 
18
the processes affecting its concentration in the strat-
19
osphere, and cloud aerosol interactions and their cli-
20
mate effects. 
21
(3) There are significant risks posed by the po-
22
tential introduction of material into the stratosphere 
23
from natural events such as volcanic eruptions, in-
24
creased air and space traffic, and proposals to inject

material to temporarily reduce global radiative forc-
1
ing of climate that currently are the subject of a 
2
forthcoming report by the National Academies of 
3
Sciences. 
4
(4) To monitor and assess these risks requires 
5
significant improvements to observations of the 
6
abundances and chemistry of the stratospheric gases 
7
and particles and the reflectivity of the stratosphere 
8
to establish the baseline state of the stratosphere 
9
and its trend over time and to develop enhancements 
10
to stratospheric models used for predicting climate 
11
impacts of material introduced into the stratosphere 
12
by natural or other means. 
13
(5) Under the Weather Modification Reporting 
14
Act of 1972 (15 U.S.C. 330 et seq.), NOAA is re-
15
sponsible for oversight of any activities undertaken 
16
to modify weather, which includes research or test-
17
ing activities related to modifying the atmosphere to 
18
affect local, regional, or global climate (defined as 
19
atmospheric climate intervention under such Act). 
20
(6) The Montreal Protocol, finalized in 1987, 
21
and ratified by the United States in 1988, has prov-
22
en to be innovative and successful in protecting the 
23
Earth’s ozone layer, and is the only environmental 
24
treaty to achieve universal ratification by all coun-

tries in the world. The United States has been a 
1
leader within the Protocol throughout its existence. 
2
Hence, the Protocol should remain the governing 
3
global agreement to protect the stratospheric ozone 
4
layer.
