A BILL 
To ensure the United States diplomatic workforce at all 
levels reflects the diverse composition of the United States. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Represent America 
4
Abroad Act of 2020’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) As the United States becomes more racially 
8
and ethnically diverse, the Department of State 
9

must continue to invest in policies to recruit, retain, 
1
and develop the best and brightest from the full 
2
spectrum of American society in order to be better 
3
positioned to advance United States interests 
4
abroad. 
5
(2) Foreign Service officers are America’s face 
6
to the world. Thus, the workforce must represent the 
7
United States commitment to inclusion and diversity 
8
in order to effectively advance American values on 
9
the world stage. 
10
(3) The Department of State must embrace 
11
policies that recruit professionals from the broadest 
12
possible pool of talent and retain them in order to 
13
significantly increase diversity in the Foreign Serv-
14
ice. Timely action to increase diversity at the mid- 
15
levels is crucial, as it takes approximately nine years 
16
for an entry level Foreign Service officer (class 6, 5, 
17
4) to rise to the mid-ranks of the Foreign Service 
18
(class 3, 2, or 1). 
19
(4) A February 2020 report by the Government 
20
Accountability Office found barriers to a diverse and 
21
inclusive workforce at the Department of State, es-
22
pecially at the mid-career and senior levels. Individ-
23
uals who are racial or ethnic minorities comprise 
24
only 24 percent of Foreign Service officers as a 
25
01:56 Aug 08, 2020
H7673

•HR 7673 IH
whole. At the executive level, individuals who are ra-
1
cial or ethnic minorities comprise only 13 percent. 
2
This means that the leadership is the least diverse 
3
level within the Foreign Service. 
4
(5) In the past, the Department of State has 
5
acknowledged its lack of workforce diversity and 
6
pledged to take concrete steps to address the prob-
7
lem. In 2017, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson 
8
recognized a great diversity gap in the Department 
9
of State and former Secretary of State John Kerry 
10
noted that in order to represent the United States, 
11
the Department of State must have a workforce that 
12
reflects the rich composition of its citizenry. Yet 
13
there has been no concrete plan to address the lack 
14
of diversity at the mid-career and senior levels.
