tax on certain new heavy trucks, tractors, and trail-

ers, coupled with new regulatory mandates, signifi-
1
cantly increasing the cost of new heavy-duty trucks, 
2
tractors, and trailers, and discourages the replace-
3
ment of older, less environmentally clean and less 
4
fuel economical vehicles; 
5
(2) this 12-percent Federal retail excise tax is 
6
the highest percentage rate of any Federal ad valo-
7
rem excise tax; 
8
(3) the Federal excise tax was first levied by 
9
Congress in 1917 to help finance America’s involve-
10
ment in World War I; 
11
(4) the 12-percent Federal retail excise tax rou-
12
tinely adds between $12,000 and $22,000 to the cost 
13
of a heavy truck, tractor, or trailer; 
14
(5) the average in-use, heavy truck is 9.6 years 
15
old, close to the historical all-time high; 
16
(6) the Environmental Protection Agency’s 
17
model year 2002–2010 tailpipe emissions rules ac-
18
count for $20,000 of the average price of today’s 
19
new heavy-duty trucks;

21

for Medium and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles’’, 
1
model year 2014–2018 EPA–Department of Trans-
2
portation fuel economy rules will add up to approxi-
3
mately $6,683 to the price of new heavy-duty trucks; 
4
(8) according to the 2016 Environmental Pro-
5
tection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety 
6
Administration Final Rule entitled ‘‘Greenhouse Gas 
7
Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Me-
8
dium and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles—Phase 
9
2’’, model year 2021–2027 fuel economy rules will 
10
add up to approximately $12,500 to the price of new 
11
heavy-duty trucks; 
12
(9) the $39,183 average per truck cost of these 
13
regulatory mandates results in an additional $4,700 
14
Federal excise tax, on average; 
15
(10) since the Federal retail excise tax on cer-
16
tain new heavy trucks, tractors, and trailers is based 
17
on annual sales, receipts from the tax deposited in 
18
the Highway Trust Fund can vary greatly; 
19
(11) Congress should consider a more reliable 
20
and consistent revenue mechanism to protect the 
21
Highway Trust Fund; and 
22
(12) Congress should advance the deployment 
23
of the most modern, clean, and safe trucks through 
24
eliminating the Federal excise on trucks.
