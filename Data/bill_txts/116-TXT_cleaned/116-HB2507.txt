with the National Academy of Medicine (in this section

referred to as ‘‘NAM’’) (or if NAM declines to enter into 
2
such an agreement, another appropriate entity) under 
3
which NAM, or such other appropriate entity, agrees to 
4
conduct a study on the following: 
5
(1) The uniform screening panel review and 
6
recommendation processes to identify factors that 
7
impact decisions to add new conditions to the uni-
8
form screening panel, to describe challenges posed 
9
by newly nominated conditions, including low-inci-
10
dence diseases, late onset variants, and new treat-
11
ments without long-term efficacy data. 
12
(2) The barriers that preclude States from add-
13
ing new uniform screening panel conditions to their 
14
State screening panels with recommendations on re-
15
sources needed to help States implement uniform 
16
screening panel recommendations. 
17
(3) The current state of federally and privately 
18
funded newborn screening research with rec-
19
ommendations for optimizing the capacity of this re-
20
search, including piloting multiple prospective condi-
21
tions at once and addressing rare disease questions. 
22
(4) New and emerging technologies that would 
23
permit screening for new categories of disorders, or

would make current screening more effective, more 
1
efficient, or less expensive. 
2
(5) Technological and other infrastructure 
3
needs to improve timeliness of diagnosis and short- 
4
and long-term follow-up for infants identified 
5
through newborn screening and improve public 
6
health surveillance. 
7
(6) Current and future communication and edu-
8
cational needs for priority stakeholders and the pub-
9
lic to promote understanding and knowledge of a 
10
modernized newborn screening system with an em-
11
phasis on evolving communication channels and mes-
12
saging. 
13
(7) The extent to which newborn screening 
14
yields better data on the disease prevalence for 
15
screened conditions and improves long-term out-
16
comes for those identified through newborn screen-
17
ing, including existing systems supporting such data 
18
collection and recommendations for systems that 
19
would allow for improved data collection.

(b) REPORT.—Not later than 18 months after the ef-
21
fective date of the agreement under subsection (a), such 
22
agreement shall require NAM, or such other appropriate

entity, to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human

5
esses described in subsection (a)(1); and
