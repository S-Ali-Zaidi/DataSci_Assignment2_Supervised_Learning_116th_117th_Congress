•HR 1404 IH
(1) According to an Intelligence Community As-
1
sessment dated January 6, 2017, ‘‘Russian Presi-
2
dent Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign 
3
in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Rus-
4
sia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US 
5
democratic process . . . Moscow’s influence cam-
6
paign followed a Russian messaging strategy that 
7
blends covert intelligence operations—such as cyber 
8
activity—with overt efforts by Russian Government 
9
agencies, state-funded media, third-party inter-
10
mediaries, and paid social media users or ‘trolls’.’’. 
11
(2) According to the indictment issued by the 
12
Attorney General on February 16, 2018, Russian 
13
actors conspired ‘‘to defraud the United States by 
14
impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful 
15
functions of the government through fraud and de-
16
ceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. po-
17
litical and electoral processes, including the presi-
18
dential election of 2016’’. 
19
(3) Notwithstanding the enactment of the 
20
Countering Adversaries of America through Sanc-
21

22

23
sions among Americans, and to undermine demo-
24

(4) The government of Russian President

SEC. 3. REPORT ON KREMLIN-LINKED CORRUPTION. 
4
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
5
gress that— 
6
(1) the intelligence community should dedicate 
7
resources to further expose key networks that the 
8
corrupt political class in Russia uses to hide the 
9
money it steals; 
10
(2) the President should pursue efforts to stifle 
11
Russian use of hidden financial channels, including 
12
anonymous shell companies and real estate invest-
13
ments, in a manner similar to the efforts undertaken 
14
to tighten banking regulations after the terrorist at-
15
tacks on September 11, 2001; and 
16
(3) the United States should do more to expose 
17
the corruption of Vladimir Putin, whose ill-gotten 
18
wealth is the most powerful symbol of the corrupt 
19
nature of his government. 
20
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after the date
