SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative 
3
(StAR), a World Bank and United Nations anti- 
4
money-laundering effort, estimates that between $20 
5
billion to $40 billion has been lost to developing 
6
countries annually through corruption. 
7
(2) In 2014, more than $480 million in corrup-
8
tion proceeds hidden in bank accounts around the 
9
world by former Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha and 
10
his co-conspirators was forfeited through efforts by 
11
the Department of Justice. 
12
(3) In 2010, the Department of Justice estab-
13
lished the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, to 
14
work in partnership with Federal law enforcement 
15
agencies to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official 
16
corruption and, where appropriate, return those pro-
17
ceeds to benefit the people harmed by these acts of 
18
corruption and abuse of office. 
19
(4) Of the $20 billion to $40 billion lost by de-
20
veloping countries annually through corruption, only 
21
about $5 billion has been repatriated in the last 15 
22
years. 
23
(5) Governments weakened by corruption and 
24
loss of assets due to corruption have fewer resources 
25
to devote to the fight against terrorism and fewer re-
26
18:06 Jan 19, 2019
H389
3 
•HR 389 IH
sources to devote to building strong financial, law 
1
enforcement, and judicial institutions to aid in the 
2
fight against the financing of terrorism. 
3
(6) The United States has a number of effective 
4
programs to reward individuals who provide valuable 
5
information that assist in the identification, arrest, 
6
and conviction of criminal actors and their associ-
7
ates, as well as seizure and forfeiture of illicitly de-
8
rived assets and the proceeds of criminal activity. 
9
(7) The Internal Revenue Service has the Whis-
10
tleblower Program, which pays awards to individuals 
11
who provide specific and credible information to the 
12
IRS if the information results in the collection of 
13
taxes, penalties, interest or other amounts from non-
14
compliant taxpayers. 
15
(8) The Department of State administers re-
16
wards programs on international terrorism, illegal 
17
narcotics, and transnational organized crime with 
18
the goal of bringing perpetrators to justice. 
19
(9) None of these existing rewards programs 
20
specifically provide monetary incentives for identi-
21
fying and recovering stolen assets linked solely to 
22
foreign government corruption, as opposed to crimi-
23
nal prosecutions or civil or criminal forfeitures. 
24
18:06 Jan 19, 2019
H389

•HR 389 IH
(10) The recovery of stolen assets linked to for-
1
eign government corruption and the proceeds of such 
2
corruption may not always involve a BSA violation 
3
or lead to a forfeiture action. In such cases there 
4
would be no ability to pay rewards under existing 
5
Treasury Department authorities. 
6
(11) Foreign government corruption can take 
7
many forms but typically entails government officials 
8
stealing, misappropriating, or illegally diverting as-
9
sets and funds from their own government treasuries 
10
to enrich their personal wealth directly through em-
11
bezzlement or bribes to allow government resources 
12
to be expended in ways that are not transparent and 
13
may not either be necessary or be the result of open 
14
competition. Corruption also includes situations 
15
where public officials take bribes to allow govern-
16
ment resources to be expended in ways which are 
17
not transparent and may not be necessary or the re-
18
sult of open competition. These corrupt officials 
19
often use the United States and international finan-
20
cial system to hide their stolen assets and the pro-
21
ceeds of corruption. 
22
(12) The individuals who come forward to ex-
23
pose foreign governmental corruption and kleptocra-
24
cy often do so at great risk to their own safety and 
25
18:06 Jan 19, 2019

•HR 389 IH
that of their immediate family members and face re-
1
taliation from persons who exercise foreign political 
2
or governmental power. Monetary rewards and the 
3
potential award of asylum can provide a necessary 
4
incentive to expose such corruption and provide a fi-
5
nancial means to provide for their well-being and 
6
avoid retribution. 
7
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
8
gress that a Department of the Treasury stolen asset re-
9
covery rewards program to help identify and recover stolen 
10
assets linked to foreign government corruption and the 
11
proceeds of such corruption hidden behind complex finan-
12
cial structures is needed in order to— 
13
(1) intensify the global fight against corruption; 
14
and 
15
(2) serve United States efforts to identify and 
16
recover such stolen assets, forfeit proceeds of such 
17
corruption, and, where appropriate and feasible, re-
18
turn the stolen assets or proceeds thereof to the 
19
country harmed by the acts of corruption.
