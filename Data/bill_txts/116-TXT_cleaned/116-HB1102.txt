(2) In December 2018, the Russian Federation 
1
sent two Tu–160 nuclear-capable bombers to Ven-
2
ezuela for joint exercises with the Venezuelan mili-
3
tary. The Tu–160 can carry conventional or nuclear- 
4
tipped cruise missiles with an estimated maximum 
5
range of around 3,000 miles. 
6
(3) Russian and Venezuelan forces took part in 
7
a joint 10-hour exercise across the Caribbean in De-
8
cember 2018 with the Tu–160 nuclear-capable 
9
bombers. 
10
(4) The Maduro regime has turned to the Rus-
11
sian Federation, one of its strongest political allies, 
12
for financial support during its current economic cri-
13
sis. 
14
(5) Nicolas Maduro secured loans from the 
15
Russian Federation to be repaid through future oil 
16
exports, but fell behind on those payments in 2017. 
17
News reports in December 2018 suggest that Rus-
18
sian State oil company Rosneft has lent Venezuelan 
19
state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PdVSA) 
20
$6.5 billion partly as prepayment for crude oil, $3.1 
21
billion of which remained outstanding as of the end 
22
of September 2018. 
23
(6) In 2016, PdVSA secured a $1.5 billion loan 
24
from Rosneft, and PdVSA used 49.9 percent of its

shares in United States-based and Venezuelan- 
1
owned company CITGO as collateral. A Venezuelan 
2
default could lead to potential Russian ownership of 
3
United States energy infrastructure. 
4
(7) At the conclusion of a 3-day visit to Moscow 
5
in December 2018, Maduro announced $6 billion 
6
worth of Russian investment pledges focused on the 
7
oil and mining sectors as well as the export of 
8
600,000 tons of Russian wheat to Venezuela to 
9
cover its 2019 needs.
