SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) High school e-cigarette use increased by 
7
135 percent between 2017 and 2019. 
8
(2) Middle school e-cigarette use increased by 
9
approximately 218 percent between 2017 and 2019. 
10
(3) Results from the National Youth Tobacco 
11
Survey of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
12
vention (in this section referred to as ‘‘CDC’’) and 
13
the Food and Drug Administration (in this section 
14
referred to as ‘‘FDA’’) published in December 2019 
15
show that 27.5 percent of high school students and 
16
10.5 percent of middle school students reported 
17
using an e-cigarette in the previous 30 days, up 
18
from 20.8 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively, in 
19
2018. 
20
(4) In 2019, more than one-third (34.2 percent) 
21
of high school e-cigarette users reported using e- 
22
cigarettes products frequently, on 20 to 30 days in 
23
the past month. 
24
(5) The CDC, the FDA, the Department of 
25
Health and Human Services, the Surgeon General, 
26
00:38 Dec 28, 2019
H5482

•HR 5482 IH
and various State and local health authorities have 
1
determined the skyrocketing e-cigarette use amongst 
2
American youth to be an ‘‘epidemic’’. 
3
(6) According to the CDC, the use of nicotine 
4
among adolescents can be detrimental to memory 
5
making, learning, and behavior, and e-cigarette use 
6
has been linked to lung conditions and mysterious 
7
illness. 
8
(7) According to data from the FDA’s Popu-
9
lation Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, 
10
youth e-cigarette use is associated with more than 
11
four times the odds of trying cigarettes and nearly 
12
three times the odds of current cigarette use. 
13
(8) The CDC and FDA continue to reiterate 
14
that the use of any tobacco product, including e- 
15
cigarettes, is unsafe for young people.
