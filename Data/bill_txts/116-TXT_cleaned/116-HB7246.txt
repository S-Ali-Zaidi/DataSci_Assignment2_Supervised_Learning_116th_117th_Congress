SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The 2017 National Security Strategy states, 
3
‘‘the United States will deepen collaboration with 
4
our European allies and partners to confront forces 
5
threatening to undermine our common values, secu-
6
rity interests, and shared vision. The United States 
7
and Europe will work together to counter Russian 
8
subversion and aggression, and the threats posed by 
9
North Korea and Iran. We will continue to advance 
10
our shared principles and interests in international 
11
forums.’’. 
12
(2) After the end of World War II, the presence 
13
of foreign military forces in Germany was governed 
14
by a law signed in April 1949 that allowed France, 
15
the United Kingdom, and the United States to re-
16
tain forces in Germany. 
17
(3) The initial law was succeeded by the Con-
18
vention on the Presence of Foreign Forces in the 
19
Federal Republic of Germany, signed at Paris on 
20
October 23, 1954, allowing eight North Atlantic 
21
Treaty Organization (NATO) members, specifically 
22
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, 
23
the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the 
24
United States, to maintain a long-term presence of 
25
military forces in Germany.
