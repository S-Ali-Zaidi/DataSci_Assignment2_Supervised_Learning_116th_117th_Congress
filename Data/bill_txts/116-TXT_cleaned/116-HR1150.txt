ful elections in October 2020. 
Whereas it is in the interest of the United States to maintain 
a strong relationship with a democratic, peaceful, stable, 
and economically prosperous Coˆte d’Ivoire whose leaders 
prioritize good governance, the rule of law, and respect 
for human rights;

Whereas Coˆte d’Ivoire has a presidential election scheduled 
for October 31, 2020; 
Whereas previous transitions of power have been marred by 
conflict and violence against civilians, including most re-
cently in 2010–2011, when 3,000 civilians were killed 
during an election-related dispute; 
Whereas the root causes of past political violence—including 
religious and ethnoregional tensions, contestation over 
land, politicization of the judiciary and concerns over due 
process, and a lack of professionalism, adequate training, 
and civilian control over the security forces—have not 
been adequately addressed; 
Whereas political leaders have previously manipulated and ex-
ploited religious, ethnic, and regional identities and eco-
nomic grievances to incite violence including through inci-
dents of hateful and divisive speech occurring both in 
person and online; 
Whereas President Ouattara’s decision to stand for a third 
term, despite a two-term limit in the constitution, has 
heightened tensions, and several citizens have been killed 
and dozens more injured or arrested amid protests 
against his candidacy; 
Whereas political violence in Coˆte d’Ivoire could threaten the 
region’s stability and economic development prospects, 
and undermine efforts to counter violent extremism and 
terrorist activity; 
Whereas the Government of Coˆte d’Ivoire must protect the 
health and safety of its citizens and prevent the spread 
of COVID–19 while also ensuring credible elections and 
enabling the participation of all voters;

mitted to efforts to prevent conflict and atrocities and ad-
dress the root causes of fragility, as evidenced by the en-
actment of the Global Fragility Act of 2019 and the Elie 
Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018; 
and 
Whereas the United States Embassy in Coˆte d’Ivoire issued 
a statement on August 25, 2020, ‘‘supporting free, trans-
parent, and inclusive elections in Coˆte d’Ivoire’’ and urg-
ing ‘‘all parties, groups and individuals to refrain from 
violence and hateful/divisive speech and to choose dia-
logue to find peaceful solutions to their disagreements’’:
