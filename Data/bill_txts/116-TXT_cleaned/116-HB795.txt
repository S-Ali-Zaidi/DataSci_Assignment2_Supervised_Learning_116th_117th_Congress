A BILL 
To require the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a 
study on the economic and environmental risks to the 
Great Lakes of spills or leaks of oil, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preserve Our Lakes 
4
and Keep Our Environment Safe Act’’.

Congress finds that—

(1) the Great Lakes are an invaluable national 
1
resource, containing one-fifth of the world’s fresh 
2
surface water and 95 percent of the United States 
3
freshwater supply; 
4
(2) over 40,000,000 people depend on the Great 
5
Lakes for fresh drinking water; 
6
(3) the Great Lakes provide 56,000,000,000 
7
gallons of water per day for municipal, agricultural 
8
and industrial use; 
9
(4) there are more than 3,500 species of plants 
10
and animals within the Great Lakes ecosystem; 
11
(5) hundreds of thousands of jobs, tied to the 
12
$7,000,000,000 
recreational 
fishing 
and 
13
$16,000,000,000 recreational boating industries, di-
14
rectly depend on the Great Lakes; 
15
(6) currently, several million gallons per day of 
16
hazardous liquids are transported by pipeline across 
17
various points along the Great Lakes; 
18
(7) modeling studies by the University of Michi-
19
gan in 2014 and 2016 have concluded that an oil 
20
spill originating from a pipeline under the Straits of 
21
Mackinac would present particularly severe con-
22
sequences, potentially impacting over 700 miles of 
23
Great Lakes shoreline;

•HR 795 IH
(8) a joint NOAA-U.S. Coast Guard guidebook 
1
on oil spill response planning in marine environ-
2
ments states that, during the first 24 to 48 hours 
3
of open water exposure, most oil spills become dif-
4
ficult to recover, burn, or chemically disperse; 
5
(9) swift currents beneath the straits and wa-
6
terways which connect the Great Lakes could rapidly 
7
disperse oil spill contaminants following a pipeline 
8
breach; 
9
(10) certain pipelines on the Great Lakes are 
10
located in close proximity to municipal drinking 
11
water collection intakes for millions of people; and 
12
(11) the United States should seek to protect 
13
the Great Lakes, as a unique national asset, from 
14
unreasonable risk of environmental and economic 
15
harm.

TO THE GREAT LAKES.

(a) STUDY.—Notwithstanding a pipeline integrity 
19
management program, integrity management assessment 
20
schedule, or considerations by the Secretary of Transpor-
21
tation resulting in a corrective action order pursuant to 
22
section 60112 of title 49, United States Code, not later 
23
than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, 
24
the Secretary shall, in consultation with the United States 
25

•HR 795 IH
Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
1
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and other agen-
2
cies as appropriate, conduct a study to determine the eco-
3
nomic and environmental risks to the Great Lakes of spills 
4
or leaks of oil or other hazardous liquids in the Straits 
5
of Mackinac from a rupture, breakage, or other failure of 
6
onshore, underwater pipeline facilities within the Straits. 
7
(b) CONTENTS.—The study required under sub-
8
section (a) shall— 
9
(1) meet the content requirements of an envi-
10
ronmental impact statement as described in part 
11
1502 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations; 
12
(2) describe the potential impacts of such spills 
13
or leaks to the public health or welfare, wildlife pop-
14
ulations, ecosystems, shorelines, public and private 
15
property, economic activity, and water quality in the 
16
Great Lakes and connecting waterways; 
17
(3) include an assessment of spill responses in 
18
a variety of likely and worst-case spill scenarios in 
19
those waters; and 
20
(4) include the supplemental study conducted 
21
under subsection (c). 
22
(c) SUPPLEMENTAL
STUDY.—The Secretary of 
23
Transportation shall conduct, in collaboration with pipe-
24
line facility operators and any necessary agencies, a sup-
25

•HR 795 IH
plemental study to evaluate the condition and structural 
1
integrity of onshore, underwater pipeline facilities in the 
2
Straits of Mackinac, taking into consideration the age, 
3
construction materials, external and internal corrosion, 
4
weld integrity, pressure, underwater currents, possible ex-
5
ternal damage caused by anchor strikes or dragging by 
6
recreational or cargo vessels, and the presence of in-line 
7
shutoff valves. Such supplemental study shall utilize both 
8
internal inspection technology and pipeline route surveys, 
9
depth of cover surveys, pressure tests, external corrosion 
10
direct assessment, or other technology that the operator 
11
demonstrates can further the understanding of the condi-
12
tion of the pipeline facility. 
13
(d) TERMINATION OF OPERATION.—Not later than 
14
12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
15
Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
16
Safety Administration shall terminate the operations of an 
17
onshore, underwater pipeline facility located in the Straits 
18
of Mackinac if the Administrator determines that, based 
19
on the studies conducted under subsections (a) and (c), 
20
such facility poses a sufficient risk of hazard to life, prop-
21
erty, or the environment to necessitate the termination.
