more than 70,800,000 forcibly displaced persons, in-
1
cluding 25,900,000 refugees worldwide, over half of 
2
whom are children, according to estimates from the 
3
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
4
(2) In 2018, less than 5 percent of global reset-
5
tlement needs were met despite there being 
6
1,400,000 refugees in need of third-country resettle-
7
ment. 
8
(3) The United States refugee admissions pro-
9
gram is a life-saving solution that— 
10
(A) is critical to global humanitarian ef-
11
forts; 
12
(B) strengthens global security; 
13
(C) leverages United States foreign policy 
14
interests, including diplomatic and strategic in-
15
terests of supporting allies who often host a sig-
16
nificant and disproportionate share of refugees 
17
per capita; 
18
(D) stabilizes sensitive regions impacted by 
19
forced migration by ensuring that the United 
20
States shares responsibility for global refugee 
21
protection;

United States to encourage other countries to

uphold the human rights of refugees, including 
1
by ensuring that refugees—

an education, and freedom of movement; 
4
and 
5
(ii) are not returned to a place in 
6
which their life or freedom is at risk;

(F) serves individuals and families in need 
8
of resettlement; 
9
(G) provides economic and cultural bene-
10
fits to cities, States, and the United States as 
11
a whole; and 
12
(H) aligns with the international obliga-
13
tions of the United States, including under— 
14
(i) the Convention Relating to the 
15
Status of Refugees, done at Geneva July 
16
28, 1951 (as made applicable by the Pro-
17
tocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 
18
done at New York January 31, 1967 (19 
19
U.S.T. 6223)), of which the United States 
20
is a party; 
21
(ii) the Convention against Torture 
22
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
23
Treatment or Punishment, done at New

(iii) the Convention relating to the

Status of Stateless Persons, done at New 
4
York September 28, 1954; and 
5
(iv) the Convention on the Reduction 
6
of Statelessness, done at New York August 
7
30, 1961. 
8
(4) The United States has historically been, 
9
and should continue to be, a global leader in— 
10
(A) responding to displacement crises 
11
around the world, including through the provi-
12
sion of robust humanitarian support; 
13
(B) promoting the safety, health, and well- 
14
being of refugees and displaced persons; 
15
(C) welcoming asylum seekers who seek 
16
safety and protecting other at-risk migrants, in-
17
cluding survivors of torture, victims of traf-
18
ficking, and stateless people; and 
19
(D) working alongside other countries to 
20
strengthen protection systems and support. 
21
(5) The United States has steadily reduced— 
22
(A) access to asylum protection through 
23
administrative 
policy 
and 
programmatic 
24
changes, including policies and operational deci-

sions aimed at reducing or stopping the ability 
1
of asylum seekers to access the United States 
2
border; and 
3
(B) the resettlement of refugees, by way of 
4
two consecutive historically low annual refugee 
5
admissions goals after nearly 45 years during 
6
which the average annual United States refugee 
7
admissions goal was over 95,000 individuals. 
8
(6) Refugees are— 
9
(A) the most vetted travelers to enter the 
10
United States; and 
11
(B) subject to extensive screening checks, 
12
including in-person interviews, biometric data 
13
checks, and multiple interagency checks. 
14
(7) The people of the United States, and com-
15
munities across the United States, overwhelmingly 
16
support refugees and asylum seekers, including peo-
17
ple of faith, members of the Armed Forces, veterans, 
18
elected officials, and retired high-ranking officials. 
19
As a beacon of safe refuge and pluralistic society, 
20
the United States should commit itself to addressing 
21
the plight of refugees internationally. 
22
(8) For the sake of refugees, asylum seekers, 
23
other migrants, United States national diplomatic 
24
and strategic interests, and local communities that

within the United States Government to coordinate

and promote United States initiatives to protect ref-
4
ugees and asylum seekers.
