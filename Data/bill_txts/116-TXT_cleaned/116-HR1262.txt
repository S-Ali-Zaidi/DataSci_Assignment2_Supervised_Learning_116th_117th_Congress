RESOLUTION 
Thanking all election officials and workers for the tireless 
energy and sacrifice they made to ensure that the No-
vember 2020 election ran smoothly amidst the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
Whereas elections are the foundation of the United States de-
mocracy; 
Whereas the force of election officials and election workers, 
whose tireless efforts to make such elections possible, 
have faced unique challenges this year as they prepared 
for a projected record turnout amid the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas election workers— 
(1) open and close the polls;

(2) ensure that only a qualified voter is permitted to 
vote and that each qualified voter is permitted to vote 
once and only once; 
(3) give instructions in the method of voting when 
requested by a voter; 
(4) give assistance to illiterate and physically dis-
abled voters; 
(5) maintain order in the polling place throughout 
early voting and election day voting; 
(6) tally the vote after the polls are closed; and 
(7) certify the election results in individual precincts; 
Whereas considering that in the November 2018 election, 
there were more than 200,000 polling places in use on 
election day, and more than 600,000 poll workers pro-
vided assistance to voters, the administration of the No-
vember 2020 during a pandemic was a notable under-
taking; 
Whereas according to a 2018 report by the Election Assist-
ance Commission, in the November 2018 election, 
‘‘Forty-five States reported a total of 637,713 poll work-
ers assisting at polling places during election day for the 
2018 general election. These States reported deploying 
an average of 8.0 poll workers per polling place on elec-
tion day, an average that has been largely the same since 
the 2012 election.’’; 
Whereas a new cohort of election workers emerged and volun-
teered for the November 2020 election due to the risk 
that COVID–19 presented for the typical election worker 
population; 
Whereas the November 2020 election voter turnout far sur-
passed the November 2018 election, and election workers 
were integral to the successful November 2020 election;

Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic created unprecedented 
complexities in the administration of the election requir-
ing election officials to protect the safety of election 
workers and the voting public while conducting accurate 
and timely elections; and 
Whereas the Election Assistance Commission also recognized 
November 1 through November 7, 2020, as National 
Election Official and Election Worker Appreciation Week 
to recognize the essential work election officials and elec-
tion workers do to ensure a safe, secure, accessible, and 
accurate election that protects the health of voters and 
our democracy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives thanks 
1
all election officials and workers for the tireless energy and 
2
sacrifice they made to ensure that the November 2020

election ran smoothly amidst the COVID–19 pandemic.
