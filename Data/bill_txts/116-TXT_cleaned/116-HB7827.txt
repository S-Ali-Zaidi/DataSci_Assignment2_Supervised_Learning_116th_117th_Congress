SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Clean Energy Innova-
2
tion Funding Act of 2020’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) The urgency of the COVID-19 crisis and 
6
the climate crisis require us to advance job-creating 
7
innovation policies that reduce pollution as imme-
8
diately as possible, and one important step that we 
9
can take now is to increase our Federal investments 
10
in clean energy innovation. 
11
(2) Equally important, the far-reaching move-
12
ment for racial justice requires us to root out racism 
13
on all fronts, and one important way to do that is 
14
reduce toxic pollution that disproportionately im-
15
pacts communities of color while building a more eq-
16
uitable energy system. 
17
(3) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
18
Change Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C 
19
released on October 8, 2018, established a need for 
20
unprecedented global action to address climate- 
21
warming pollution in the next decade. 
22
(4) Fostering innovation in the development of 
23
zero-emission 
energy 
and 
industrial 
processes 
24
through increased funding for public research, devel-
25
opment, and demonstration is one essential piece of 
26
00:11 Aug 22, 2020
H7827

•HR 7827 IH
a broader suite of policies we must implement in 
1
order to meet global decarbonization goals. 
2
(5) The United States committed to doubling 
3
its public clean energy investments by fiscal year 
4
2021 when it helped launch Mission Innovation, a 
5
global initiative working to accelerate clean energy 
6
innovation, with the European Union and 22 other 
7
countries in conjunction with the 2015 Paris Agree-
8
ment. 
9
(6) While appropriations for clean energy re-
10
search and development have grown since 2015, cur-
11
rent Federal investments in clean energy are signifi-
12
cantly 
behind 
the 
scale 
needed 
to 
spur 
13
decarbonization across the United States economy. 
14
(7) The American Energy Innovation Council 
15
and the International Energy Agency have called for 
16
a tripling in clean energy funding to help ensure a 
17
more environmentally sustainable, secure, and af-
18
fordable energy system. 
19
(8) Increases in funding for the Department of 
20
Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
21
Energy, Advanced Research Projects Agency—En-
22
ergy, Office of Electricity, Office of Indian Energy 
23
Policy, and Office of Science clean energy programs, 
24
which include basic energy sciences, biological and 
25

•HR 7827 IH
environmental research, fusion research and ad-
1
vanced science computing research, are an important 
2
step in meeting United States commitments to the 
3
Mission Innovation goals and addressing the climate 
4
crisis. 
5
(9) In addition to helping address the climate 
6
crisis, these investments will also spur job growth, 
7
new business opportunities and economic recovery; 
8
help reduce air and water pollution improve energy 
9
security, help secure United States leadership in 
10
clean technology innovation, deployment, and manu-
11
facturing; and advance United States economic com-
12
petitiveness internationally as we develop and sell 
13
technologies globally. 
14
(10) Increases in funding for these research 
15
and development programs are vital to addressing 
16
pollution from difficult-to-decarbonize sectors, such 
17
as industry, aviation, shipping, and heavy-duty 
18
transportation. 
19
(11) Successful demonstration at commercial 
20
scale will be necessary to establish cost, reliability, 
21
and performance characteristics, especially in tech-
22
nology related to industrial emissions, energy stor-
23
age, and smart grid deployment.

(12) According to the International Energy 
1
Agency, demonstration is an important part of the 
2
development of new technologies that includes de-
3
sign, construction, and operation of a prototype of a 
4
technology at or near commercial scale with the pur-
5
pose of providing technical, economic, and environ-
6
mental information to industrialists, financiers, reg-
7
ulators, and policymakers. 
8
(13) Department of Energy research, develop-
9
ment, and demonstration have already resulted in in-
10
novation and cost reduction across clean energy 
11
technologies and, with increased funding, has the po-
12
tential to accelerate these to benefit all sectors and 
13
communities. 
14
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
15
It is the sense of Congress that— 
16
(1) we must help accelerate our transition to a 
17
clean-energy economy by significantly increasing in-
18
vestments in Federal research, development, and 
19
demonstration that will foster needed advancements 
20
in clean energy and deep decarbonization across the 
21
economy; 
22
(2) increased research, development, and dem-
23
onstration funding for the noted programs is not 
24
sufficient on its own to address the climate crisis, 
25
00:11 Aug 22, 2020
H7827

•HR 7827 IH
but it is an essential step that must be coupled with 
1
a suite of climate polices and investments to maxi-
2
mize adoption of cleaner processes and technologies; 
3
(3) in order to maximize the best use of this 
4
funding increase, the Department of Energy should 
5
use resources in a targeted fashion to address cli-
6
mate change, such as by participating in strategic 
7
goal setting and engaging broadly with stakeholders, 
8
including industries, utilities, labor unions, and im-
9
pacted communities, especially environmental justice 
10
communities; 
11
(4) increased Federal investments in energy re-
12
search must be used to create a more just energy 
13
system that fairly distributes clean energy benefits, 
14
facilitates more representative and inclusive energy 
15
decision making, and addresses the disproportionate 
16
burdens historically faced by low-income commu-
17
nities and communities of color; 
18
(5) it is important for these programs to main-
19
tain a comprehensive approach to innovation that in-
20
cludes early-, mid-, and late-stage research, develop-
21
ment, and market transformation activities; and 
22
(6) a modernization of Department of Energy 
23
clean energy programs would enable even greater 
24

•HR 7827 IH
progress to help address the climate crisis, includ-
1
ing— 
2
(A) an update to the Department of Ener-
3
gy’s mission to explicitly include mitigating cli-
4
mate change and increasing climate resilience 
5
would reduce existing barriers to climate-related 
6
efforts and allow the Department of Energy to 
7
specifically focus resources on emissions-reduc-
8
ing strategies; 
9
(B) expanded authorization to conduct 
10
workforce development, quality job creation, 
11
and social equity programs with a priority focus 
12
on communities of color, Tribal communities, 
13
low-income communities, deindustrialized com-
14
munities, and communities disproportionally im-
15
pacted by climate change, would better equip 
16
the applied energy offices to address these 
17
issues that will be key to mitigating climate 
18
change; 
19
(C) increased emphasis and funding for 
20
demonstration and deployment programs would 
21
increase the Department of Energy’s ability to 
22
get innovative, clean technologies into the mar-
23
ket and ensure that our investments translate
