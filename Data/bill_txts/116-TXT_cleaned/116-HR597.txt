RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that the United States 
should support, and not limit access to, all domestic 
energy sources in an effort to achieve full energy secu-
rity. 
Whereas, on September 14, 2019, two facilities belonging to 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s (KSA) state-run oil com-
pany Saudi Aramco were severely damaged in a sophisti-
cated aerial attack carried out by enemies of the King-
dom; 
Whereas, in 2018, nine percent of all petroleum imports of 
the United States came from the KSA;

Whereas, in the same year, twenty-nine percent of all petro-
leum imports of the United States came from countries 
that belong to the Organization of the Petroleum Export-
ing Countries (OPEC), including KSA; 
Whereas due to OPEC’s outsized share of the global petro-
leum market, any instability in one of its member coun-
tries can directly impact global energy markets; 
Whereas thanks to the energy renaissance of the United 
States more oil and natural gas are being produced do-
mestically than by any other nation in the world; 
Whereas the energy industry of the United States is leading 
all sectors in creating and supporting new high-quality 
jobs; 
Whereas technological advances in the domestic energy indus-
try have resulted in large reductions in the dispersal of 
harmful pollutants into the environment; 
Whereas nuclear power has generated approximately one-fifth 
of the electricity used in the United States each year 
since 1990 and currently provides over fifty-five percent 
of the carbon-free electricity of the United States; 
Whereas renewable sources of energy account for eleven per-
cent of domestic energy consumption; 
Whereas the United States has abundant coal reserves, in-
cluding a demonstrated reserve base estimated to contain 
475,000,000,000 short tons; and 
Whereas it is in the national security interests of the United 
States to control its own energy supply: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives that the United States should support, and
