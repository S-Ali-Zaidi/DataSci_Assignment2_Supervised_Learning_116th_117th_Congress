‘‘SEC. 231. FINDINGS. 
13
‘‘Congress finds the following: 
14
‘‘(1) Our Nation’s schools are experiencing a 
15
severe diversity gap that negatively impacts student 
16
achievement and school culture—50 percent of cur-
17
rent students are from minority groups while only 
18
18 percent of teachers are from such groups, accord-
19
ing to a 2016 study by the Brookings Institution. 
20
‘‘(2) A 2016 report conducted by the Depart-
21
ment of Education shows that teachers of color tend 
22
to provide more culturally relevant teaching and bet-
23
ter understand the situations that students of color 
24
may face. These factors help develop trusting teach-
25
er-student relationships. Researchers from Vander-

•HR 4288 IH
bilt University also found that greater racial and 
1
ethnic diversity in the principal corps benefits stu-
2
dents, especially students of color. 
3
‘‘(3) Minority teachers and school leaders can 
4
also serve as cultural ambassadors who help stu-
5
dents feel more welcome at school or as role models. 
6
‘‘(4) Research shows that increasing diversity in 
7
the teaching profession can have positive impacts on 
8
student educational experiences and outcomes. Stu-
9
dents of color demonstrate greater academic achieve-
10
ment and social-emotional development in classes 
11
with teachers of color. Studies also suggest that all 
12
students, including White students, benefit from 
13
having teachers of color because they bring distinc-
14
tive knowledge, experiences, and role modeling to the 
15
student body as a whole. 
16
‘‘SEC. 232. PURPOSE.

‘‘The purpose of this subpart is to strengthen and 
18
expand the recruitment, training, and retention of diverse 
19
candidates into the teaching profession.
