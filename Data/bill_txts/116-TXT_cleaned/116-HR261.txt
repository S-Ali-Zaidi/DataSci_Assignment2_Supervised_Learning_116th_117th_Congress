of India. 
Whereas, on February 14, 2019, a Pakistan-based terrorist 
organization attacked an Indian Central Reserve Police 
Force convoy, killing at least 40 Indian paramilitary 
forces and wounding at least 44 others; 
Whereas the United States and United Nations (U.N.) des-
ignated terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has

Whereas JeM is one of numerous terrorist groups that re-
ceive safe haven in Pakistan; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2017 Country Reports on 
Terrorism states, ‘‘The Pakistani government failed to 
significantly limit Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT) and JeM 
from openly raising money, recruiting, and training in 
Pakistan.’’; 
Whereas LeT conducted the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 
more than 160 individuals and injured at least 300 oth-
ers in a series of attacks that targeted a railway station, 
a popular restaurant, a hospital, two hotels, and a Jewish 
center; 
Whereas the 2017 Country Reports on Terrorism also states, 
‘‘The Pakistani government did not restrict the Afghan 
Taliban and the Haqqani Network from operating in 
Pakistan-based safe havens while threatening U.S. and 
Afghan forces in Afghanistan.’’; 
Whereas, in 2017, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), 
an international body focused on combating terrorist fi-
nancing, continued to state concern that Pakistan’s out-
standing gaps in the implementation of the U.N. Security 
Council’s sanctions regimes against ISIL (Da’esh) and 
al-Qaida have not been resolved, and that U.N.-listed en-
tities, including LeT and its affiliates, were not effec-
tively prohibited from raising funds in Pakistan, nor 
being denied financial services; 
Whereas, in June 2018, the FATF placed Pakistan on the 
grey list due to the country’s strategic deficiencies in its 
antimoney laundering and combating financing of ter-
rorism regime;

•HRES 261 IH 
Whereas, in February 2019, the FATF assessed Pakistan’s 
progress towards delisting and stated, ‘‘[Pakistan] does 
not demonstrate a proper understanding of the TF [ter-
rorism financing] risks posed by Da’esh, al-Qa’ida, 
Jamaatud Dawa, Falah-i-Insaniyay Foundation, LeT, 
JeM, the Haqqani Network, and persons affiliated with 
the Taliban’’; 
Whereas the United States and India share a mutually bene-
ficial political, economic, and security partnership; 
Whereas, in 2005, the United States and India launched a 
strategic partnership that served to broaden and deepen 
the security cooperation between the two countries; 
Whereas the security cooperation between the United States 
and India plays an essential role in combating terrorism 
in the region, including the India-U.S. Counterterrorism 
Joint Working Group; 
Whereas the United States and India have pledged to 
strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from 
groups, including al-Qaida (AQ), ISIS, JeM, LeT, and 
D-Company; and 
Whereas the United States is committed to working with the 
Government of India to combat terrorism in all forms: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
