•HR 7733 IH
(1) On January 3, 2020, the leading public 
1
health authority in the People’s Republic of China, 
2
the National Health Commission, directed all Chi-
3
nese research institutions to cease publicly pub-
4
lishing any information related to a then unknown 
5
SARS-like virus, and ordered them to destroy exist-
6
ing samples of the virus or transfer them to ap-
7
proved testing sites. 
8
(2) On December 30, 2019, Dr. Li Wenliang 
9
warned his medical school classmates of an outbreak 
10
of an unknown SARS-like virus over WeChat. 
11
(3) On January 3, 2020, Wuhan’s Public Secu-
12
rity Bureau detained, questioned, and forced Dr. Li 
13
Wenliang and seven other doctors to sign a letter 
14
confessing he had made ‘‘false comments’’ that ‘‘se-
15
verely disturbed the social order’’. 
16
(4) On February 7, 2020, one month after 
17
checking into Wuhan Central Hospital, Dr. Li 
18
Wenliang died of a severe case of coronavirus dis-
19
ease 2019 (commonly known as ‘‘COVID-19’’). 
20
(5) China’s National Health Commission pub-
21
licly denied COVID–19 was person-to-person trans-
22
missible until January 15, 2020, despite having un-
23
covered contrary evidence in late December 2019

and being alerted of the transmissibility of COVID–

19 on January 1, 2020.

(6) China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Zhao 
3
Lijian, claimed that COVID–19 originated in the 
4
United States and that the United States Army 
5
brought the virus to Wuhan to wage biological war-
6
fare on China. 
7
(7) Other Chinese Government officials, includ-
8
ing scientists working on China’s COVID–19 re-
9
sponse, China’s Ambassador to South Africa and 
10
China’s Ambassador to Australia have claimed that 
11
there is no evidence that COVID–19 originated in 
12
China. 
13
(8) A study by the University of Southampton 
14
found that had China taken action 3 weeks earlier, 
15
the spread of COVID-19 could have been reduced by 
16
95 percent. 
17
(9) On July 21, 2020, Representative Adam 
18
Smith defended the Chinese Government’s hiding 
19
the true nature of COVID-19 when he said, ‘‘It’s 
20
not actually their job to warn the American people’’. 
21
(10) According to the World Health Organiza-
22
