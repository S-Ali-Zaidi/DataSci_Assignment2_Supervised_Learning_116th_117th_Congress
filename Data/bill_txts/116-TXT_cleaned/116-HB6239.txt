•HR 6239 IH
(1) The United States diversity of backgrounds, 
1
cultures, perspectives, skills, and experiences is a na-
2
tional asset that has assisted in realizing United 
3
States foreign policy, security, and economic goals, 
4
yet according to recent government statistics, diverse 
5
communities continue to be underrepresented in 
6
international public service careers and leadership 
7
roles. 
8
(2) According to census data, the United 
9
States, European, and other societies are becoming 
10
more diverse, indicating an increasing need for glob-
11
al leaders with expertise in policymaking and govern-
12
ance that can competently represent the needs of di-
13
verse constituencies and ensure that democratic val-
14
ues and practices are equally applied to and offer 
15
the same protections and opportunities for all. 
16
(3) There is therefore a compelling need to en-
17
courage outstanding young people from diverse and 
18
underserved populations to pursue international pub-
19
lic service careers. 
20
(4) There is also a need for international lead-
21
ership training opportunities for individuals serving 
22
in national, regional, and local governments and par-
23
liaments around the world, and for individuals serv-
24
ing as employees of Members of Congress and as

employees of members of other legislatures, that in-
1
cludes a focus on civil and human rights and the in-
2
clusion of diverse and underserved populations in 
3
policymaking and governance. 
4
(5) The establishment and operation of an in-
5
stitute for the training and development of a diverse 
6
and inclusive group of global leaders to serve in 
7
international public service careers would address 
8
these critical needs.
