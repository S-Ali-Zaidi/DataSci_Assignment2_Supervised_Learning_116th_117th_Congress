public health emergency, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pandemic Response 
2
and Opportunity Through National Service Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The United States has a strong history of 
6
citizen response to national calls to service in order 
7
to help the Nation recover in times of crisis. 
8
(2) More than 80 years ago, the Nation rose to 
9
the challenge of the Great Depression with the cre-
10
ation of citizen service programs like the Civilian 
11
Conservation Corps (referred to in this section as 
12
the ‘‘CCC’’) and the Works Progress Administration 
13
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘WPA’’). 
14
(3) Millions of participants benefitted from paid 
15
employment and opportunities to develop their skills 
16
while constructing national parks and public lands 
17
infrastructure and producing cultural works still en-
18
joyed today. 
19
(4) Following decades of evolution, incor-
20
porating policies of both political parties, today’s na-
21
tional service programs carry on the legacy of the 
22
CCC and WPA. 
23
(5) Founded in 1990, the Corporation for Na-
24
tional and Community Service today coordinates na-
25
tional service by individuals in the United States 
26
02:36 May 14, 2020
H6702

•HR 6702 IH
across every State and territory, partnering with 
1
State-level commissions and supporting locally driv-
2
en services in partnership with nongovernmental or-
3
ganizations and State governments. 
4
(6) National service programs provide public 
5
health, education, employment training, and nutri-
6
tion services for which the Nation has a critical need 
7
in the current crisis. 
8
(7) The signature programs of the Corporation 
9
for National and Community Service, which are the 
10
AmeriCorps State and National, AmeriCorps Na-
11
tional 
Civilian 
Community 
Corps, 
AmeriCorps 
12
VISTA, and National Senior Service Corps pro-
13
grams, can and should be expanded to meet current 
14
needs. 
15
(8) The novel coronavirus pandemic has in-
16
fected and killed individuals in every State and terri-
17
tory, causing more than 1,000,000 cases and 65,000 
18
deaths so far. 
19
(9) In response, States, tribal governments, and 
20
cities across the country have closed down busi-
21
nesses, schools, and public events, leading to a dra-
22
matic drop in economic activity and a sharp pro-
23
jected decline in the United States economy. 
24
02:36 May 14, 2020
H6702

•HR 6702 IH
(10) More than 30,000,000 applications for un-
1
employment benefits have been filed in recent weeks, 
2
with weekly filings repeatedly exceeding historic 
3
record levels. 
4
(11) More than 1 in every 10 adults in the 
5
United States has applied for unemployment insur-
6
ance since the crisis began. 
7
(12) Public health leaders agree that to safely 
8
reopen the Nation and revive its economy, a massive 
9
effort to test millions of individuals in the United 
10
States and to trace contacts of those who are or may 
11
be infected is needed. 
12
(13) To recover, the Nation also needs mean-
13
ingful employment opportunities, as well as a signifi-
14
cant expansion of the human capital working to ad-
15
dress community needs around public health, behav-
16
ioral health, hunger, education, and conservation. 
17
(14) As the Nation works to respond to and re-
18
cover from the current twin challenges of a public 
19
health pandemic and an economic crisis, national 
20
service presents a unique opportunity for flexible, lo-
21
cally driven responses to meet State and local public 
22
health, employment, and recovery needs.
