Whereas the ‘‘2019 U.S. Energy and Employment Report’’ 
found that— 
(1) energy and energy efficiency sectors employ ap-
proximately 6,700,000 people; and 
(2) the number of jobs in those sectors grew by 
more than 2 percent from 2017 to 2018; 
Whereas the scaling of clean energy is essential to reducing 
harmful pollution; 
Whereas clean energy jobs are inherently local, contribute to 
the growth of local economies, and cannot be outsourced 
due to the on-site nature of construction, installation, 
and maintenance; and 
Whereas innovative clean energy solutions and clean energy 
jobs are part of the energy future of the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
