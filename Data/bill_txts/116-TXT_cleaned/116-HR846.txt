RESOLUTION 
Urging the people of the United States to observe the month 
of April of each year as Hazel M. Johnson Environ-
mental Justice Month. 
Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency defines envi-
ronmental justice as the fair treatment and meaningful 
involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, na-
tional origin, or income, with respect to the development, 
implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, 
regulations, and policies; 
Whereas fair treatment suggests that communities should not 
endure an inordinate amount of adverse environmental 
consequences related to commercial, industrial, or govern-
mental policies;

Whereas the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People urges that environmental injustice, in-
cluding the proliferation of climate change, has a dis-
proportionate impact on communities of color and low-in-
come communities in the United States; 
Whereas Hazel M. Johnson, widely regarded as the mother 
of the environmental justice movement, fought for envi-
ronmental justice in Chicago beginning in the 1970s; 
Whereas, in 1979, Johnson founded People for Community 
Recovery, a grassroots organization focused on empow-
ering communities to fight against environmental racism 
and injustice; 
Whereas Johnson lived in Altgeld Gardens, a Chicago Hous-
ing Authority public housing project that was exposed to 
sources of environmental hazards, including from indus-
trial factories, sewage treatment facilities, asbestos, and 
lead; 
Whereas Johnson investigated the effects of environmental 
hazards at Altgeld Gardens by engaging governmental 
bodies and documenting chronic health issues after her 
husband died of lung cancer and their children contracted 
respiratory and skin conditions; 
Whereas Johnson, through her investigations, uncovered that 
Altgeld Gardens was built on high concentrations of haz-
ardous waste that contributed to chronic health burdens, 
drinking water contamination, and air pollution; 
Whereas Johnson and People for Community Recovery in-
formed residents of Altgeld Gardens of their right to pro-
tection from environmental and health hazards through 
workshops, trainings, rallies, and youth programs;

Whereas Johnson and People for Community Recovery held 
both businesses and governments accountable for neg-
ligent waste disposal and pollution practices by engaging 
in protests, hearings, petitions, and lobbying government 
officials; 
Whereas Johnson and People for Community Recovery not 
only benefitted South Side Chicago communities, but also 
led national conversations to improve the fair treatment 
and meaningful involvement of all communities seeking 
equal protection from hazards; 
Whereas Johnson testified before the United States Congress 
regarding the need for public-private partnerships to sup-
port environmental justice initiatives, which resulted in 
the formalization of a Federal interagency working group 
to address concerns; and 
Whereas Johnson, through vigilance and activism, gave low- 
income and minority communities a voice in the fight 
against environmental racism and injustice: Now, there-
fore, be it
