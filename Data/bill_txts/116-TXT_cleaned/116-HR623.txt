RESOLUTION 
Recognizing and honoring National Mushroom Day and the 
contributions of Chester and Berks Counties to the na-
tional mushroom industry. 
Whereas October 15 is National Mushroom Day; 
Whereas, since the cultivation of mushrooms began in France 
in 1651, the cultivation of mushrooms has been developed 
and advanced through the hard work of mushroom grow-
ers; 
Whereas mushrooms are a dietary staple due to their nutri-
tional value; 
Whereas, in 1885, a successful florist in Kennett Square, 
Pennsylvania, conceived the idea of growing mushrooms 
beneath his greenhouse benches, leading to the first dedi-
cated mushroom growing operation in the area;

Whereas over 60 percent of United States mushrooms are 
now grown in Chester and Berks Counties, Pennsylvania; 
Whereas the mushroom farms in Chester County include both 
large and small farms, including multigeneration family 
farms, demonstrating the region’s support for small busi-
nesses and local producers; 
Whereas the local mushroom growers meet and collaborate, 
leading to the innovation that distinguishes the region 
and its mushroom industry; and 
Whereas the mushroom growers and the farmworker commu-
nity contribute substantially to the local economy, em-
ploying nearly 10,000 workers and bringing an estimated 
$2,700,000,000 into Chester County: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the recognition of National Mush-
2
room Day; and 
3
(2) honors the region of Chester and Berks 
4
