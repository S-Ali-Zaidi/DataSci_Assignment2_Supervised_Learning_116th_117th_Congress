abolition of the Lao monarchy, and May 1, 2020, marks 
the 45th year since the Hmong, Lao, and other Lao eth-
nic minorities from Laos began their evacuation from 
Laos; 
Whereas 2020 commemorates the 45th year of the beginning 
of the resettlement of Southeast Asian refugees to the 
United States; 
Whereas Southeast Asian Americans comprise more than 
3,000,000 individuals in the United States and include 
the Cham, Hmong, Khmer, Khmer Kampuchea Krom, 
Khmer Loeu, Khmu, Lahu, Lao, Iu Mien, Montagnards, 
Phutai, Pnong, Tai Dam, Tai Deng, Tai Lue, and Viet-
namese; 
Whereas the United States intervened in Cambodia, Laos, 
and Vietnam to prevent the spread of communism in 
Southeast Asia through direct military interventions and 
covert and clandestine operations; 
Whereas the Vietnamese from South Vietnam allied with the 
United States in opposition to the expansion of North 
Vietnam until the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, and 
many Vietnamese still suffer lasting trauma from the 
war, including exposure to Agent Orange and post-trau-
matic stress disorder; 
Whereas the Central Intelligence Agency and various dif-
ferent agencies enlisted the Hmong, Lao, and Laotian 
ethnic groups in Laos as allies to aid United States 
forces in Southeast Asia, waging a 13-year covert oper-
ation called the ‘‘Secret Wars’’ against the Pathet Lao, 
Viet Cong, and Northern Vietnamese Army; 
Whereas the United States heavily bombed Laos, leaving the 
country as the most heavily bombed country in the world,

with over 580,000 bombing missions between 1964 and 
1973; 
Whereas Cambodians assisted United States forces during 
American operations in Cambodia, including Operation 
Menu; 
Whereas the United States dropped 540,000 tons of bombs 
into Cambodia between 1969 and 1973 against Viet Cong 
forces located in Cambodia, destabilizing a fragile govern-
ment, resulting in the rise of the Khmer Rouge, and lead-
ing to the genocide of an estimated 2,000,000 Cam-
bodians; 
Whereas the United States dispersed over 13,000,000 gallons 
of Agent Orange in Vietnam, 475,000 gallons in Laos, 
and 40,900 in Cambodia during this era, with many 
Southeast Asians still impacted by the effects of this 
toxin; 
Whereas over 3,000,000 individuals were displaced by war, 
conflict, and genocide from Cambodia, Laos, and Viet-
nam; 
Whereas between 1975 to the mid-2000s, the United States 
accepted over 1,200,000 Southeast Asians escaping the 
Vietnam war, persecution in Laos, and Khmer Rouge 
genocide in Cambodia; 
Whereas the resettlement of Southeast Asian refugees in the 
United States typically placed many individuals and fami-
lies in communities with inadequate financial, long-term 
resettlement support and many of these individuals and 
their children languished in severe poverty; 
Whereas many Southeast Asian refugees have thrived and 
contributed greatly to the economic, educational, military,

political, and social culture of the United States since 
their resettlement; 
Whereas despite the success of many Southeast Asian Ameri-
cans, many still face economic, educational, and linguistic 
barriers in the United States, in particular, a significant 
percentage of Cambodian, Hmong, Lao, Vietnamese, and 
other Southeast Asian Americans endure severe poverty, 
lack of English proficiency, educational barriers, and 
unique health disparities as survivors of war and geno-
cide; 
Whereas the War on Poverty, including the Personal Respon-
sibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, de-
creased resources for low-income, refugee, and immigrant 
communities to transform from generational poverty; 
Whereas, as survivors of war and genocide, Southeast Asian 
Americans still face disparate health outcomes, including 
higher rates of physical, mental, and chronic health chal-
lenges, including over 60 percent of Cambodians and a 
significant number of other Southeast Asian Americans 
who continue to experience post-traumatic stress dis-
order; 
Whereas, as children of the survivors of war and genocide, 
first and second generation Southeast Asian Americans 
have intergenerational, compounded trauma that has cre-
ated poor mental health conditions and education bar-
riers; 
Whereas the War on Drugs, Violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act, expansion of the incarceration system, 
and over policing of low-income refugee communities re-
sulted in a significant number of Southeast Asian Ameri-

cans coming into contact with the criminal justice sys-
tem; 
Whereas the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Re-
sponsibility Act of 1996 expanded the definition of what 
type of crime could result in deportation and limited due 
process protections for immigrants, refugees, and other 
noncitizens; the Act also allowed the expanded definition 
to be applied retroactively without proper consideration of 
an individual’s lived circumstances; 
Whereas more than 15,000 Southeast Asian Americans, 
many of whom were refugees, live in the United States 
with a final order of removal and over 2,000 have been 
deported since 1998; 
Whereas many Southeast Asian Americans with a final order 
of removal are United States residents who are more 
than 10 years removed from the time of their criminal 
convictions and have moved on to become pillars of their 
communities, homeowners, fathers, mothers, caregivers, 
and tenured employees; 
Whereas the Trump administration’s approach to deportation 
breaks up families and, in some cases, the deportees have 
never lived in their country of origin, do not speak the 
language of their country of origin, or do not have a liv-
ing relative in their country of origin; 
Whereas, in December 2018, a total of 55 members of the 
House of Representatives and 13 Senators signed onto 
two separate letters by Representatives Judy Chu and 
Pramila Jayapal and Senators Mazie Hirono and Kamala 
Harris to the President, the Department of Homeland 
Security, and the Department of State urging fiscal re-

and 
Whereas, in December 2018, an additional 22 members of 
the House of Representatives signed onto a letter to the 
Department of Homeland Security opposing renegoti-
ations of the bilateral United States and Vietnam memo-
randum of understanding that would strip deportation 
protections from Vietnamese Americans who arrived in 
the United States before July 12, 1995, from deporta-
