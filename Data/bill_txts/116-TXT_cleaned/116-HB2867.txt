•HR 2867 IH
(1) An estimated 4,600,000 minors in the 
1
United States live in homes with at least 1 unse-
2
cured firearm. 
3
(2) Seventy-three percent of children under the 
4
age of 10 living in homes with firearms reported 
5
knowing the location of their parents’ firearms. 
6
Thirty-six percent of those children reported han-
7
dling their parents’ unsecured firearms. 
8
(3) The presence of unsecured firearms in the 
9
home increases the risk of unintentional and inten-
10
tional shootings. Over 75 percent of firearms used in 
11
youth suicide attempts and unintentional firearm in-
12
juries were stored in the residence of the victim, a 
13
relative, or a friend. 
14
(4) The United States Secret Service and the 
15
Department of Education report that in 65 percent 
16
of deadly school shootings the attacker obtained the 
17
firearm from his or her own home or that of a rel-
18
ative. 
19
(5) In the last decade, nearly 2,000,000 fire-
20
arms have been reported stolen. In 2016 alone, 
21
238,000 firearms were reported stolen in the United 
22
States. Between 2010 and 2016, police recovered 
23
more than 23,000 stolen firearms across jurisdic-
24
tions that were used to commit kidnappings, armed

robberies, sexual assaults, murders, and other vio-
1
lent crimes. 
2
(6) Higher levels of neighborhood gun violence 
3
drive depopulation, discourages commercial activity, 
4
and decreases property values, resulting in fewer 
5
business establishments, fewer jobs, lower home val-
6
ues, and lower home ownership rates. 
7
(7) The negative economic impact of gun vio-
8
lence in communities is tied directly to the national 
9
economy and interstate commerce. 
10
(8) Congress has the power under the interstate 
11
commerce clause and other provisions of the Con-
12
stitution of the United States to enact measures en-
13
suring firearms are securely stored.
