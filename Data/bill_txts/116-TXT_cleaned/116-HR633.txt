RESOLUTION 
Requiring that all impeachment inquiry related hearings, wit-
ness interviews and communications, document produc-
tions and examinations, proceedings, and other related 
work shall be done in an open setting and in public 
view. 
Whereas under article 1, section 2 of the Constitution, ‘‘the 
House of Representatives shall . . . have the sole Power 
of Impeachment’’;

Whereas at a press conference on September 24, 2019, the 
Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, stated, ‘‘I’m an-
nouncing the House of Representatives is moving forward 
with an official impeachment inquiry’’; 
Whereas Speaker Pelosi declared that she was ‘‘directing our 
six committees to proceed with their investigation under 
that umbrella of impeachment inquiry’’; 
Whereas there has been no formal vote on the House Floor, 
or in any of the six committees directed by Speaker 
Pelosi, to authorize any impeachment inquiry; 
Whereas, on October 3, 2019, the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the House, the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform of the House, and the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs of the House held a classified joint 
interview in which they received testimony from Ambas-
sador Kurt Volker, the former Department of State Spe-
cial Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, under the 
guise of the ‘‘impeachment inquiry’’; 
Whereas it is wholly inappropriate to conduct any impeach-
ment inquiry in a classified setting, and the American 
public deserves complete transparency from the House of 
Representatives when conducting impeachment inquiries, 
including full and complete public access any hearings, 
witness interviews and statements, documents produc-
tions and examinations, and any and all proceedings re-
lated to an impeachment inquiry; 
Whereas sunlight is the best disinfectant, and transparency 
is the best remedy against partisan politics and injustice; 
and 
Whereas an impeachment inquiry behind the veil of secrecy 
and through closed classified committee hearings under-

mines the open and transparent process afforded to each 
Member and the constituents they represent and impedes 
their review of all evidence related to impeachment as 
that they can make their own judgment on the impeach-
ment merits: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) the House of Representatives disapproves of 
2
the actions led by the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi of Cali-

fornia, to conduct work related to matters of im-

peachment in a closed and classified setting;

(3) the Speaker and the chair of each com-
11
mittee engaged in an impeachment inquiry of any 
12
kind shall give each Member of the House a min-

imum of 48-hours notice before conducting any im-
