Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a progressive, genetic 
disorder of the kidneys that causes damage to the kid-
neys and the cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, and gas-
trointestinal organ systems; 
Whereas polycystic kidney disease affects the health and fi-
nances of individuals, and equally affects individuals of 
all ages, races, ethnicities, and sexes; 
Whereas, of the individuals diagnosed with polycystic kidney 
disease, approximately 10 percent have no family history 
of the disease, with the disease developing as a sponta-
neous mutation; 
Whereas there are very few treatments and no cure for poly-
cystic kidney disease, which is 1 of the 4 leading causes 
of kidney failure in the United States; 
Whereas almost 50 percent of individuals with polycystic kid-
ney disease experience kidney failure by age 60; 
Whereas friends, loved ones, spouses, and caregivers of indi-
viduals with polycystic kidney disease can assist with the 
challenges created by polycystic kidney disease, including 
by helping such individuals maintain a healthy lifestyle 
and make regular visits to their health care providers; 
Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney 
disease and limited public awareness of the disease may 
cause individuals to forgo regular visits to their physi-
cians or avoid following the health recommendations of 
their doctors, which experts suggest could help prevent 
further complications should kidney failure occur; 
Whereas individuals who have chronic, life-threatening dis-
eases like polycystic kidney disease may experience de-
pression;
