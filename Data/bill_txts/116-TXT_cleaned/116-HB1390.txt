Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mobile Health Record 
4
Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
8
ices’ (CMS) Blue Button 2.0 Program was an-
9
nounced in April 2018 to build upon CMS’s Blue 
10
Button Program. 
11
(2) The Blue Button 2.0 Program provides 4 
12
years of Medicare part A, B, and D data for 53 mil-
13
lion Medicare beneficiaries through an Application 
14
Programming Interface (API). The data contains a 
15
variety of information including, but not limited to, 
16
a list of a patient’s providers, prescriptions, tests, 
17
and diagnoses. The Blue Button 2.0 Program re-
18
quires the use of CMS-approved applications to 
19
allow beneficiaries to download coded data. 
20
(3) Mobile applications currently exist that have 
21
the power to decode the Medicare Blue Button data 
22
and present it in a user-friendly, easy-to-read and 
23
understand format. Prior to Blue Button 2.0, the 
24
Blue Button Program allowed beneficiaries to 
25
00:29 Mar 08, 2019
H1390
3 
•HR 1390 IH
download such data, but the information was not de-
1
coded into the easy-to-read and understand format 
2
that a mobile application provides. 
3
(4) The Blue Button 2.0 Program was created 
4
to empower patients with the use of these applica-
5
tions, but additional steps need to be taken in order 
6
to ensure the program reaches its intended purpose 
7
of providing patients with their personal medical 
8
claim information to prevent harmful medical errors 
9
and reducing redundant spending. 
10
(5) According to a study published by Johns 
11
Hopkins University in 2016, more than 250,000 
12
deaths per year are due to medical error, making it 
13
the third leading cause of death in the United 
14
States. Further, millions of dollars are wasted on 
15
duplicative or unnecessary tests and procedures. 
16
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
17
gress that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ 
18
Blue Button 2.0 Program has the potential to positively 
19
influence patient behavior, improve patient safety and 
20
health outcomes, and help reduce unnecessary health care 
21
expenditures, but action needs to be taken to help the ini-
22
tiative meet the program’s goals.
