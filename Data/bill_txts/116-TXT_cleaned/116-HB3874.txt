LGBTI people around the world, and for other purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Greater Leadership

Overseas for the Benefit of Equality Act of 2019’’ or the 
3
‘‘GLOBE Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The norms of good governance, human 
7
rights protections, and the rule of law have been vio-
8
lated unconscionably with respect to lesbian, gay, bi-
9
sexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) peoples 
10
in an overwhelming majority of countries around the 
11
world, where LGBTI people face violence, hatred, 
12
bigotry, and discrimination because of who they are 
13
and whom they love. 
14
(2) In at least 68 countries, or almost 40 per-
15
cent of the world, same-sex relations and relation-
16
ships are criminalized. Many countries also crim-
17
inalize or otherwise prohibit cross-dressing and gen-
18
der-affirming treatments for transgender individuals. 
19
(3) The World Bank has begun to measure the 
20
macro-economic costs of criminal laws targeting 
21
LGBTI individuals through lost productivity, detri-
22
mental health outcomes and violence, as a step to-
23
ward mitigating those costs. 
24
(4) Violence and discrimination based on sexual 
25
orientation and gender identity are documented in 
26
04:28 Aug 02, 2019
H3874
3 
•HR 3874 IH
the Department of State’s annual Country Human 
1
Rights Reports to Congress. These reports continue 
2
to show a clear pattern of human rights violations, 
3
including murder, rape, torture, death threats, extor-
4
tion, and imprisonment, in every region of the world 
5
based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 
6
many instances police, prison, military, and civilian 
7
government authorities have been directly complicit 
8
in abuses aimed at LGBTI citizens. 
9
(5) As documented by the State Department, 
10
LGBTI individuals are subjected in many countries 
11
to capricious imprisonment, loss of employment, 
12
housing, access to health care, and societal stigma 
13
and discrimination. LGBTI-specific restrictions on 
14
basic freedoms of assembly, press, and speech exist 
15
in every region of the world. 
16
(6) Targeted sanctions are an important tool to 
17
push for accountability for violations of the human 
18
rights of LGBTI people. 
19
(7) Anti-LGBTI laws and discrimination pose 
20
significant risks for LGBTI youth who come out to 
21
their family or community and often face rejection, 
22
homelessness, and limited educational and economic 
23
opportunities. These factors contribute to increased 
24
04:28 Aug 02, 2019
H3874
4 
•HR 3874 IH
risks of substance abuse, suicide, and HIV infection 
1
among LGBTI youth. 
2
(8) Anti-LGBTI laws also increase global 
3
health risks. Studies have shown that when LGBTI 
4
people, especially LGBTI youth, face discrimination, 
5
they are less likely to seek HIV testing, prevention, 
6
and treatment services. 
7
(9) LGBTI populations are disproportionately 
8
impacted by the Mexico City Policy, also widely re-
9
ferred to as the ‘‘global gag rule’’, which has been 
10
reinstated and expanded by President Donald J. 
11
Trump. LGBTI people often receive much of their 
12
healthcare through reproductive health clinics, and 
13
organizations that cannot comply with the policy are 
14
forced to discontinue work on United States-sup-
15
ported global health projects that are frequently 
16
used by LGBTI populations, including HIV preven-
17
tion and treatment, stigma reduction, and research. 
18
(10) Because they face tremendous discrimina-
19
tion in the formal labor sector, many sex workers 
20
are also LGBTI individuals, and many sex-worker- 
21
led programs and clinics serve the LGBTI commu-
22
nity with safe, non-stigmatizing, medical and social 
23
care. USAID has also referred to sex workers as a 
24
‘‘most-at-risk population’’. The anti-prostitution loy-
25
22:53 Aug 01, 2019
H3874
5 
•HR 3874 IH
alty oath that health care providers receiving United 
1
States assistance must take isolates sex-worker-led 
2
and serving groups from programs and reinforces 
3
stigma, undermining both the global AIDS response 
4
and human rights. The Supreme Court found this 
5
requirement unconstitutional as it applies to United 
6
States nongovernmental organizations and their for-
7
eign affiliates in 2013. 
8
(11) According to the Trans Murder Monitoring 
9
Project, which monitors homicides of transgender in-
10
dividuals there were at least 369 cases of reported 
11
killings of trans and gender-diverse people between 
12
October 2017 and September 2018, an increase over 
13
previous years. 
14
(12) In many countries, intersex individuals ex-
15
perience prejudice and discrimination because their 
16
bodies do not conform to general expectations about 
17
sex and gender. Because of these expectations, medi-
18
cally unnecessary interventions are often performed 
19
in infancy without the consent or approval of 
20
intersex individuals, in violation of international 
21
human rights standards. 
22
(13) Asylum and refugee protection are critical 
23
last-resort protections for LGBTI individuals, but 
24
those who seek such protections face ostracization 
25
22:53 Aug 01, 2019
H3874
6 
•HR 3874 IH
and abuse in refugee camps and detention facilities. 
1
They are frequently targeted for violence, including 
2
sexual assault, in refugee camps and in immigration 
3
detention. LGBTI individuals may be segregated 
4
against their will for long periods in solitary confine-
5
ment, in an effort to protect them from such vio-
6
lence, but prolonged solitary confinement itself rep-
7
resents an additional form of abuse that is pro-
8
foundly damaging to the social and psychological 
9
well-being of any individual. 
10
(14) In December 2011, President Barack 
11
Obama directed all Federal foreign affairs agencies 
12
to ensure that their diplomatic, humanitarian, health 
13
and foreign assistance programs take into account 
14
the needs of marginalized LGBTI communities and 
15
persons. 
16
(15) In 2015, the Department of State estab-
17
lished the position of Special Envoy for the Human 
18
Rights of LGBTI Persons. 
19
(16) The use of United States diplomatic tools, 
20
including the Department of State’s exchange and 
21
speaker programs, to address the human rights 
22
needs of marginalized communities has helped in-
23
form public debates in many countries regarding the 
24
22:53 Aug 01, 2019
H3874
7 
•HR 3874 IH
protective responsibilities of any democratic govern-
1
ment. 
2
(17) Engaging multilateral fora and inter-
3
national institutions is critical to impacting global 
4
norms and to broadening global commitments to 
5
fairer standards for the treatment of all people, in-
6
cluding LGBTI. The United States must remain a 
7
leader in the United Nations system and has a vest-
8
ed interest in the success of that multilateral en-
9
gagement. 
10
(18) Ongoing United States participation in the 
11
Equal Rights Coalition, which is a new intergovern-
12
mental coalition of more than 40 governments and 
13
leading civil society organizations that work together 
14
to protect the human rights of LGBTI people 
15
around the world, remains vital to international ef-
16
forts to respond to violence and impunity. 
17
(19) Those who represent the United States 
18
abroad, including our diplomats, development spe-
19
cialists and military, should reflect the diversity of 
20
our country and honor America’s call to equality, in-
21
cluding through proud and open service abroad by 
22
LGBTI Americans and those living with HIV.
