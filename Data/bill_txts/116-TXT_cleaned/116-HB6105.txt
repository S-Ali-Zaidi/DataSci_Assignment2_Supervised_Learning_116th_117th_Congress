A BILL 
To ban certain small, high-powered magnets, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Magnet Injury Preven-
4
tion Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Small, high-powered magnets are commonly 
8
sold in sets of 200 or more individual magnets. 
9
(2) Small, high-powered magnets pose a hidden 
10
hazard to infants, children, and teens.

(3) When two or more high-powered magnets 
1
are ingested, the force (or flux) allows magnets to 
2
find each other across or between different segments 
3
of the digestive system. 
4
(4) When magnets connect across or between 
5
different segments of the digestive system, the result 
6
can be perforations, abscesses, or fistulas in the 
7
bowel. 
8
(5) Sometimes, the magnetic force causes the 
9
intestines to twist, cutting off blood supply and lead-
10
ing to bowel necrosis. 
11
(6) Ingestion of two or more high-powered 
12
magnets confers a high risk of abdominal catas-
13
trophe and death. 
14
(7) Children almost universally require high- 
15
cost medical intervention following high-powered 
16
magnet ingestions. 
17
(8) Evidence does not exist that warning infor-
18
mation will sufficiently reduce the hazard associated 
19
with the ingestion of small, high-powered magnets 
20
from magnet sets. 
21
(9) The absence of regulatory action to rein-
22
state standards for small, high-powered magnet sets 
23
requires legislative action.
