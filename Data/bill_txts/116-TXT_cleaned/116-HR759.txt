spread false information to implicate the Republic of 
Ukraine.

Security and the Office of the Director of National Intel-
ligence issued a joint statement, which concluded that the

tions, including from U.S. political organizations’’ and

fere with the U.S. election process’’;

Elections’’, which included analysis by the Central Intel-
ligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 
the National Security Agency that asserted ‘‘Russian 
President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign 
in 2016 aimed at the U.S. Presidential election. Russia’s 
goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. demo-
cratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her 
electability and potential presidency’’; 
Whereas the unclassified report from the intelligence commu-
nity found that ‘‘Putin and the Russian Government de-
veloped a clear preference for President-elect Trump’’ as

chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton 
and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him’’. On No-
vember 11, 2017, the Central Intelligence Agency, led by

issued the ‘‘Report on Russian Active Measures’’ which 
states, ‘‘In 2015, Russia began engaging in a covert in-
fluence campaign aimed at the U.S. Presidential elec-
tion.’’. The report goes on to state, ‘‘Russia conducted 
cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions in 2015–2016’’ 
and ‘‘Russian-state actors and third-party intermediaries 
were responsible for the dissemination of documents and 
communications stolen from U.S. political organizations’’. 
The report also found that ‘‘Russian intelligence lever-
aged social media in an attempt to sow social discord and 
to undermine the U.S. electoral process’’;

ligence, Dan Coats, publicly stated that ‘‘Russia con-
ducted an unprecedented influence campaign to interfere 
in the U.S. electoral and political process’’;

carrying into at least 2017, against U.S. election infra-
structure at the state and local level’’. The report also 
stated that ‘‘the Committee found that the IRA (Internet

Research Agency) sought to influence the 2016 U.S. 
Presidential election by harming Hillary Clinton’s 
chances of success and supporting Donald Trump at the 
direction of the Kremlin . . . the Committee found that 
IRA social media activity was overtly and almost invari-
ably supportive of then-candidate Trump, and to the det-
riment of Secretary Clinton’s campaign’’; 
Whereas, on February 2, 2017, Russian President Vladimir 
Putin said in a press conference with Hungarian Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban that ‘‘as we all know, during the 
Presidential campaign in the United States, the Ukrain-
ian Government adopted a unilateral position in favor of 
one candidate. More than that, certain oligarchs, cer-
tainly with the approval of the political leadership, fund-
ed this candidate, or female candidate, to be more pre-
cise.’’; 
Whereas, on November 13, 2019, when asked whether there 
was any factual basis to support the allegation that 
Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, 
George Kent, testified before the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, 
‘‘To my knowledge, there is no factual basis, no . . . I 
think it’s amply clear that Russian interference was at 
the heart of the interference in the 2016 election cycle.’’; 
Whereas, on November 15, 2019, when asked about allega-
tions that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 United States 
elections, former United States Ambassador to Ukraine

tives, ‘‘the U.S. intelligence community has concluded 
that it was Russia.’’;

Whereas, on November 21, 2019, former National Security 
Council Senior Director for Europe and Russia, Fiona 
Hill testified before the Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence of the House of Representatives, ‘‘Based on 
questions and statements I have heard, some of you on 
this Committee appear to believe that Russia and its se-
curity services did not conduct a campaign against our 
country—and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, 
Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been 
perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security serv-
ices themselves.’’; and 
Whereas, on December 9, 2019, Director of the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation, Christopher A. Wray stated, ‘‘We 
have no information that indicates that Ukraine inter-
fered with the 2016 Presidential election.’’: Now, there-
