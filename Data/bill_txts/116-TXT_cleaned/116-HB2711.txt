Act of 1982 (30 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to require the 
Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations to reduce 
and prevent gas waste and to enhance gas measuring 
and reporting, to codify a final rule of the Environmental

for the oil and natural gas sector, and for other pur-
poses.

The amendments to the Code of Federal Regulations

12
the Environmental Protection Agency may revise such reg-
13
ulations, as provided for under the Clean Air Act, if such

(d) APPLICATION OF PRIOR RULE.—The final rule 
8
entitled ‘‘Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royal-
9
ties, and Resource Conservation’’, as published in the Fed-
10
