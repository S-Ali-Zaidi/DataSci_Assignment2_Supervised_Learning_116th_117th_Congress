SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The members of the Prairie Island Indian 
3
Community and their ancestors have occupied what 
4
is now northern Iowa and Minnesota since long be-
5
fore European contact, and their ancestors were 
6
present to greet the first French explorers and trad-
7
ers who entered the Upper Mississippi watershed. 
8
(2) The Tribe’s Reservation is located on an is-
9
land called Prairie Island on the Mississippi River in 
10
southeastern Minnesota, and was acquired in trust 
11
by the Secretary for the Tribe under the Indian Re-
12
organization Act of 1934 (Act of June 18, 1934, Ch. 
13
576, 48 Stat. 984), to serve as the Tribe’s perma-
14
nent homeland. 
15
(3) In 1938, the Army Corps of Engineers lo-
16
cated and constructed Lock and Dam No. 3 on the 
17
Upper Mississippi River less than two miles down-
18
stream from the Prairie Island Reservation. 
19
(4) The operation of Lock and Dam No. 3 
20
caused permanent inundation of land on the Prairie 
21
Island Reservation, as well as ongoing overbank 
22
flooding of Reservation land, much of which lies 
23
within the Mississippi River 100-year flood plain. 
24
(5) The flooding of a significant portion of the 
25
Prairie Island Reservation occurred without express 
26

Congressional authorization, as required by the Con-
1
stitution and the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, 
2
(section 2116 of the Revised Statutes; 25 U.S.C. 
3
177). 
4
(6) In 1972, the Federal Government licensed 
5
the siting of the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating 
6
Plant on Prairie Island approximately 600 yards 
7
from the Prairie Island Reservation, and later au-
8
thorized the storage of spent nuclear fuel on-site. On 
9
December 16, 1973, Unit 1 of the Plant started op-
10
eration and Unit 2 of the Plant started operating on 
11
December 21, 1974, both pursuant to 20-year oper-
12
ating licenses. 
13
(7) On June 27, 2011, the Nuclear Regulatory 
14
Commission renewed the Unit 1 and 2 operating li-
15
censes at the plant for an additional 20 years, au-
16
thorizing their continued operation until 2033 and 
17
2034, respectively. 
18
(8) The plant’s nuclear reactor core contains 
19
zirconium-clad rods filled with enriched uranium pel-
20
lets. The Federal courts have confirmed that the 
21
spent fuel and fuel assembly materials, while no 
22
longer useful for nuclear power generation, continue 
23
to pose a dangerous health threat, remaining lethally 
24
radioactive long into the future.

(9) The plant is now home to 44 dry casks that 
1
are loaded with spent nuclear fuel rods, stored in 
2
close proximity to a church, Tribal homes, a daycare 
3
center, government, cultural, language, and edu-
4
cation offices, the Tribe’s Community Center, and 
5
Tribal businesses. The Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
6
sion has licensed the storage of an additional 54 dry 
7
casks of spent nuclear fuel at the plant by 2034. 
8
(10) There is only one improved and main-
9
tained road leading on and off of the island, and it 
10
is shared by the Prairie Island Reservation and the 
11
Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant. The road 
12
crosses a busy rail corridor at grade and so can be 
13
and is often blocked by railroad traffic. 
14
(11) As a result, the Tribe’s entire Reservation 
15
is under constant threat of nuclear contamination 
16
and the means of escape is limited. 
17
(12) The operation of Lock and Dam No. 3, in 
18
combination with the close proximity of the Prairie 
19
Island Nuclear Generating Plant and spent nuclear 
20
fuel to the Prairie Island Reservation, threatens the 
21
safety and well-being of the Tribe and its members. 
22
(13) This Act will protect the Tribe and its 
23
members, will support the Tribe’s long-term health 
24
and self-sufficiency by acquiring reservation trust

land for the Tribe located at a safe distance from 
1
Lock and Dam No. 3 and the Prairie Island Nuclear 
2
Generating Plant, and will relieve the United States

from liability related to the flooding of the Tribe’s
