TITLE III—ELECTION FRAUD

SEC. 301. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) the right to vote is a fundamental right of 
8
citizens of the United States; 
9
(2) it is the responsibility of the State and Fed-
10
eral Governments to ensure that elections are con-
11
ducted with integrity; 
12
(3) the Committee on House Administration of 
13
the House of Representatives, which is charged with 
14
investigating election irregularities, received reports 
15
through its official Election Observer Program for 
16
the 2018 general election that individuals other than 
17
voters themselves were depositing large amounts of 
18
absentee ballots at polling places throughout Cali-
19
fornia, a practice colloquially known as ‘‘ballot har-
20
vesting’’; 
21
(4) the practice of ballot harvesting in Cali-
22
fornia creates significant vulnerabilities in the chain- 
23
of-custody of ballots because individuals collecting 
24
ballots are not required to be registered voters and 
25

•HR 7905 IH
are not required to identify themselves at a voter’s 
1
home, and the State does not track how many bal-
2
lots are harvested in an election; 
3
(5) in North Carolina, a congressional election 
4
was invalidated due to fraud associated with ballot 
5
harvesting committed by a political operative, and it 
6
is unlikely such activity would have been detected 
7
were it not for the prohibition against ballot har-
8
vesting in the State; and 
9
(6) ballot harvesting invites electioneering activ-
10
ity at home and creates the possibility of undue in-
11
fluence over voters by political operatives.
