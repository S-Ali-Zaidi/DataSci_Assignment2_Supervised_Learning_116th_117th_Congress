SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
23
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
24
00:23 Apr 09, 2019
H1811
4 
•HR 1811 IH
(1) The Government of China and the Com-
1
munist Party of China employ a wide range of polit-
2
ical, informational, and economic measures to influ-
3
ence, coerce, intimidate, or undermine the United 
4
States interests or the interests of United States 
5
partners and allies. 
6
(2) The December 2017 National Security 
7
Strategy of the United States of America states, 
8
‘‘Although the United States seeks to continue to co-
9
operate with China, China is using economic induce-
10
ments and penalties, influence operations, and im-
11
plied military threats to persuade other states to 
12
heed its political and security agenda.’’. 
13
(3) The political influence operations efforts of 
14
the Government of China and the Communist Party 
15
of China have received less scrutiny than similar ef-
16
forts of the Government of the Russian Federation, 
17
but given China’s economic strength and the grow-
18
ing apparatus being used to spread its influence 
19
globally, efforts to promote its authoritarian ideal 
20
pose significant and consequential long-term chal-
21
lenges to United States interests and values. 
22
(4) The Government of China and the Com-
23
munist Party of China use overt and covert means 
24
to target the political and economic elite, the media 
25

•HR 1811 IH
and public opinion, civil society and academia, and 
1
members of the Chinese diaspora. 
2
(5) The Government of China and the Com-
3
munist Party of China employ an array of govern-
4
ment entities, friendship and exchange organiza-
5
tions, private entities and businesspeople, and gov-
6
ernment-funded foundations, think tanks, edu-
7
cational and other projects to carry out political in-
8
fluence operations, which is often referred to as 
9
united front work. 
10
(6) These political influence operations violate 
11
national sovereignty, and as such, are fundamentally 
12
different from traditional efforts by states to shape 
13
international policy debates and improve their public 
14
image through public diplomacy and strategic com-
15
munications campaigns. 
16
(7) The aims of the political influence oper-
17
ations of the Government of China and the Com-
18
munist Party of China are— 
19
(A) to protect the political security of the 
20
Chinese Communist Party, both within China 
21
and globally; 
22
(B) to domestically and globally promote 
23
the idea that the Chinese Communist Party’s 
24

•HR 1811 IH
political and economic model is superior to the 
1
governments of Western democracies; and 
2
(C) to promote the interests of the regime 
3
globally. 
4
(8) The political influence operations of the 
5
Government of China and the Communist Party of 
6
China take advantage of the open and democratic 
7
nature of the United States, including— 
8
(A) constitutional protections for free 
9
speech and a free press; and 
10
(B) the desire of some individuals or insti-
11
tutions to attract Chinese investment, gain ac-
12
cess to Chinese markets, or attain greater glob-
13
al influence. 
14
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
15
gress that— 
16
(1) the political influence operations of the Gov-
17
ernment of China and the Communist Party of 
18
China are not ‘‘soft power’’ intended to persuade, 
19
but ‘‘sharp power’’ intended— 
20
(A) to penetrate or corrupt democratic 
21
countries and undermine democratic institu-
22
tions and freedoms; 
23
(B) to foster attitudes, behavior, laws, and 
24
policies favorable to the Government of China’s 
25

interest through disinformation, coercion, cor-
1
ruption, and other means; 
2
(C) to widen the scope of Chinese authori-
3
tarian influence around the world, including— 
4
(i) to suppress political opposition to 
5
the Chinese Communist Party; and 
6
(ii) to violate the internationally rec-
7
ognized human and civil rights of Chinese 
8
citizens living in nations around the world; 
9
and 
10
(D) to undermine the strength of American 
11
alliances around the world; and 
12
(2) the American people need reliable and cur-
13
rent information— 
14
(A) to identify the key institutions, individ-
15
uals, entities, and ministries that carry out such 
16
operations; and 
17
(B) to distinguish between malign political 
18
influence operations intended to undermine core 
19
American freedoms, democratic institutions, 
20
and cultural, educational, business, and people- 
21
to-people exchanges that may benefit the 
22
United States and China.

5
