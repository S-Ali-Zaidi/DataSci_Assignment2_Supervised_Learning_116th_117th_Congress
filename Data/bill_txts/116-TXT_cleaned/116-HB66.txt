SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 66 IH
(1) Route 66 was the Nation’s first all-paved 
1
highway under the U.S. Highway System connecting 
2
the Midwest to California and has played a major 
3
role in the history of the United States. 
4
(2) Route 66 was the symbol of opportunity to 
5
hundreds of thousands of people seeking escape from 
6
the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, serving as a ‘‘road to 
7
opportunity’’ in the West and providing employment 
8
during the Great Depression, as thousands were put 
9
to work on road crews to pave the road. 
10
(3) Route 66 was invaluable in transporting 
11
troops, equipment, and supplies across the country 
12
to the West, where the government established mul-
13
tiple industries and armed force bases during World 
14
War II. Upon the conclusion of the war in 1945, 
15
Route 66 was a key route taken by thousands of 
16
troops as they returned home. 
17
(4) Route 66 symbolized the Nation’s positive 
18
outlook during the postwar economic recovery in the 
19
1950s and 1960s, serving as an icon of free-spirited 
20
independence and linking people across the United 
21
States. During this period, the tourist industry 
22
along Route 66 grew tremendously, giving rise to 
23
countless tourist courts, motels, service stations, ga-
24
rages, and diners.

•HR 66 IH
(5) Since June 27, 1985, when Route 66 was 
1
decommissioned as a Federal highway, the popu-
2
larity and mythical stature of Route 66 has grown 
3
domestically and internationally, as the road has ex-
4
perienced a rebirth of interest and support. 
5
(6) The year 2026 will be the centennial anni-
6
versary of Route 66, and a commission should be es-
7
tablished to study and recommend to Congress ac-
8
tivities that are fitting and proper to celebrate that 
9
anniversary in a manner that appropriately honors 
10
America’s Mother Road.
