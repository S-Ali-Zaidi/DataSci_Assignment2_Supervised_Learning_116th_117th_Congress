A BILL 
To amend title 18, United States Code, to clarify the crim-
inalization of female genital mutilation, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strengthening the Op-
4
position to Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2020’’ or the 
5
‘‘STOP FGM Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
7
The Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Female genital mutilation is recognized 
9
internationally as a human rights violation and a 
10

form of child abuse, gender discrimination, and vio-
1
lence against women and girls. Female genital muti-
2
lation is a global problem whose eradication requires 
3
international cooperation and enforcement at the na-
4
tional level. The United States should demonstrate 
5
its commitment to the rights of women and girls by 
6
leading the way in the international community in 
7
banning this abhorrent practice. 
8
(2) Congress has previously prohibited the com-
9
mission of female genital mutilation on minors. Fe-
10
male genital mutilation is a heinous practice that 
11
often inflicts excruciating pain on its victims and 
12
causes them to suffer grave physical and psycho-
13
logical harm. 
14
(3) Congress has the power under article I, sec-
15
tion 8 of the Constitution to make all laws which 
16
shall be necessary and proper for carrying into exe-
17
cution treaties entered into by the United States. 
18
(4) Congress also has the power under the 
19
Commerce Clause to prohibit female genital mutila-
20
tion. An international market for the practice exists, 
21
and persons who perform female genital mutilation 
22
in other countries typically earn a living from doing 
23
so.

(5) Those who perform this conduct often rely 
1
on a connection to interstate or foreign commerce, 
2
such as interstate or foreign travel, the transmission 
3
or receipt of communications in interstate or foreign 
4
commerce, the use of instruments traded in inter-
5
state or foreign commerce, or payments of any kind 
6
in furtherance of this conduct. 
7
(6) Amending the statute to specify a link to 
8
interstate or foreign commerce would confirm that 
9
Congress has the affirmative power to prohibit this 
10
conduct.

shall submit to Congress a report that includes—

(1) an estimate of the number of women and

girls in the United States at risk of or who have

SEC. 5. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. 
13
It is the sense of the Congress that the United States 
14
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan erred 
15
in invalidating the prior version of such section 116 (See 
16
United States v. Nagarwala, 350 F. Supp. 3d 613, 631 
17
(E.D. Mich. 2018)). The commercial nature of female gen-
18
ital mutilation (hereinafter in this section referred to as 
19
‘‘FGM’’) is ‘‘self-evident,’’ meaning that the ‘‘absence of 
20
particularized findings’’ about the commercial nature of 
21
FGM in the predecessor statute did not ‘‘call into question 
22
Congress’s authority to legislate’’ (Gonzales v. Raich, 545 
23
U.S. 1, 21 (2005)). Nevertheless, the Congress has elected 
24
to amend the FGM statute to clarify the commercial na-
25
21:18 Mar 10, 2020

•HR 6100 IH
ture of the conduct that this statute regulates. But, by 
1
doing so, Congress does not hereby ratify the district 
2
court’s erroneous interpretation in Nagarwala.
