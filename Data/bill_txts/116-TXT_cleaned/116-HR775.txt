Whereas Smokey Bear was the first individual animal ever to 
be honored on a postage stamp and receives so much 
mail he has his own ZIP Code; 
Whereas Smokey Bear has worked diligently with the United 
States Forest Service to educate Americans of all ages 
and particularly America’s youth, the future stewards of 
our forests, about the need for vigilance regarding 
wildfires and forest health; 
Whereas Smokey Bear released videos for his 75th birthday 
that included celebrity voiceovers filling in for Smokey, 
all stating Smokey’s signature ‘‘only you can prevent 
wildfires’’ slogan and directing viewers back to Smokey 
Bear’s website to learn more about forest health; 
Whereas Smokey Bear’s website includes a ‘‘Benefits of Fire’’ 
section that describes fire as ‘‘one of nature’s most essen-
tial agents of change’’ that ‘‘can trigger a rebirth of for-
ests’’; 
Whereas Native Americans and indigenous people long used 
prescribed fires to manipulate and improve landscapes, 
maintain prairies, and preserve healthy ecosystems; 
Whereas while there are benefits to occasional natural fires 
under specific conditions, it is important to remember 
Smokey’s ABCs: Always Be Careful with fire; 
Whereas Smokey Bear’s commitment to educating the public 
about wildfires can be applied to the need to improve 
public awareness about the benefits of prescribed fires, 
and how they are one of the most effective tools in pre-
venting wildfires and managing the intensity and spread 
of wildfires; 
Whereas Smokey Bear’s dedication to forest health can be 
applied to educating the public about the benefits of nat-

ural fires in maintaining healthy ecosystems dependent 
on periodic fires, supporting native vegetation, promoting 
wildlife diversity, and reducing excessive amounts of dead 
plant material; 
Whereas Smokey Bear’s message of vigilance can be applied 
to overall forest health and protection, including the man-
agement of invasive species, the effects of insect and dis-
ease infestations, the impacts of changing climates, water 
quality and quantity, and increasingly severe weather 
events; and 
Whereas the United States Forest Service, the National Asso-
ciation of State Foresters, and the Advertising Council 
have provided extraordinary support and dedication to 
the purposes and efforts of Smokey Bear: Now, therefore,
