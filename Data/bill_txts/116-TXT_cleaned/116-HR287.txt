RESOLUTION 
Condemning the President’s threat to shut down the United 
States-Mexico border to the detriment of the United 
States economy. 
Whereas President Trump is threatening to shut down the 
United States-Mexico border if Mexico does not stop the 
flow of Central American children and families to the 
United States; 
Whereas the sudden closure of the United States-Mexico bor-
der would have grave consequences for the American

State in the Union;

Whereas the unexpected supply chain disruption caused by 
suddenly closing the United States-Mexico border could 
result in work stoppages at American auto and manufac-
turing plants, risking the furlough of American workers 
and the shutdown of production lines; 
Whereas the disruption caused by suddenly closing the 
United States-Mexico border could result in severe short-
ages of many fruits, vegetables, and other fresh food, 
leading to collapsing food supplies, soaring food prices, 
and bare shelves in groceries nationwide; 
Whereas suddenly closing the United States-Mexico border 
could have further consequences on the American farm 
economy, hurting family farms, growers, pork producers, 
dairy producers, and more, leading to rotting produce 
and other disruptions felt later in the season; 
Whereas spending by Mexican tourists in the United States 
totaled $20.3 billion in 2016 alone; 
Whereas the President’s counterproductive policies have con-
sistently worsened the situation at the United States- 
Mexico border; 
Whereas, since fiscal year 2016, Congress has invested more 
than $2.6 billion to support implementation of the United 
States Strategy for Engagement in Central America 
aimed at strengthening communities in the region and 
preventing children and families from making the dan-
gerous trek from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras 
to the United States-Mexico border; 
Whereas suspending United States assistance to Central 
America will worsen conditions in Central America and 
promote increased migration to the United States;

Whereas according to former United States Southern Com-
mand (SOUTHCOM) Commander Admiral James Stav-
ridis, ‘‘The best thing we could do to reduce the flow of 
refugees from Central America is to help them improve 
conditions there. Suddenly stopping all foreign aid there 
will only increase the driving forces creating the caravans 
over time, which will be even more costly to deal with on 
our border. It is like stopping your preventative medica-
tions, then wondering why you need surgery a year 
later.’’; 
Whereas only one day after the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity entered into a promising multilateral compact with 
Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to address migra-
tion flows, the President announced plans to terminate 
United States foreign assistance to those countries; 
Whereas the President blocking the use of funds appropriated 
by Congress for bipartisan initiatives that address the 
root causes of child and family migration from Central 
America will exacerbate the situation at the border; 
Whereas instead of working to reduce humanitarian suffering 
at the United States-Mexico border, the President has in-
tentionally worsened conditions for asylum-seeking indi-
viduals who have a right to due process and humane 
treatment when arriving at the border; 
Whereas Congress appropriated $192,700,000 above the 
President’s budget request for fiscal year 2019 for U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for humanitarian 
relief at the southern border, including $128,000,000 for 
contract medical professionals, $40,200,000 for food, in-
fant formula and diapers, and $24,500,000 for transpor-
tation between CBP facilities;

Whereas Congress appropriated funding for 484 immigration 
judge teams in fiscal year 2018, of which only 395 were 
on-board as of September 30, 2018, and provided fund-
ing for 534 immigration judge teams in fiscal year 2019; 
and 
Whereas the President’s conduct in the name of border secu-
rity has consistently worsened the humanitarian needs at 
the United States-Mexico border and threatened further 
chaos in the jobs, economy, and daily lives of American 
families across the country: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) opposes the President’s reckless threatened 
2
closure of the United States-Mexico border, which 
3
would severely jeopardize the Nation’s economic, na-
4
tional, and homeland security interests; 
5
(2) opposes the President’s action blocking the 
6
funds appropriated by Congress to address the root 
7
causes of migration at their source, thereby need-
8
lessly fueling the situation at the United States-Mex-
9
ico border; and 
10
(3) affirms asylum-seeking individuals have a 
11
right to due process and humane treatment when ar-
12
riving at the United States-Mexico border, consistent 
13
with our most treasured American values as a Na-
14
tion that has been a beacon and a refuge to the 
15
world.
