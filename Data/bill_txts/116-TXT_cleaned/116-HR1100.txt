RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming the strategic partnership between the United 
States and Mongolia and observing the 30th anniversary 
of democracy in Mongolia. 
Whereas the United States and Mongolia established diplo-
matic relations in January 1987, and since that time the 
relationship has grown stronger based on shared strategic 
interests, security cooperation, democratic values, good 
governance, and respect for human rights; 
Whereas, since its peaceful democratic revolution in 1989, 
Mongolia has charted, through a series of initiatives, a 
successful path to multiparty democracy and a free mar-
ket economy;

Whereas, in 1990, the Government of Mongolia declared an 
end to a one-party, authoritarian, political system and 
adopted democratic and free market reforms; 
Whereas, in 1992, Mongolia adopted a constitution estab-
lishing a parliamentary democracy, becoming the first 
country in Asia to transition from communism to democ-
racy; 
Whereas Mongolia has shown its commitment to a ‘‘third 
neighbor’’ relationship with the United States by sending 
troops to support United States operations in Iraq from 
2003 through 2008 and Afghanistan since 2009, and 
Mongolia has a strong record of troop contributions to 
international peacekeeping missions; 
Whereas successive Mongolian governments have taken nota-
ble steps to strengthen civil society, battle corruption, 
and spur economic development; 
Whereas the Parliament of Mongolia, the State Great 
Khural, has engaged with Congress, including through 
the House Democracy Partnership, thereby promoting re-
sponsive and effective governance through peer-to-peer 
cooperation; 
Whereas Mongolia began as a partner to the Organization for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 2004, 
graduated to become a participating state in 2012, and 
participates actively in the work of the OSCE for sta-
bility, peace, and democracy; 
Whereas Mongolia has regularly invited the OSCE and other 
organizations to send monitoring teams to its Presi-
dential and parliamentary elections; 
Whereas Mongolia has also been an active member of the 
Community of Democracies (CoD), a global coalition of 
22:56 Sep 04, 2020

•HRES 1100 IH 
countries that support adherence to common democratic 
values and standards, and Mongolia has not only re-
mained active since the founding of the CoD in 2000 but 
also successfully chaired the CoD from 2011 through 
2013; 
Whereas, in addition to supporting the OSCE and CoD, Mon-
golia supports democratic initiatives while participating 
in a wide range of other global institutions; 
Whereas most recently, on June 24, 2020, Mongolia success-
fully organized parliamentary elections, strengthening its 
commitment to democracy and the rule of law; 
Whereas the success of Mongolia as a democracy and its stra-
tegic location, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and abil-
ity to pursue an independent foreign policy are highly rel-
evant to the national security of the United States; 
Whereas the United States has provided support to Mongolia 
through the Millennium Challenge Corporation through 
an initial compact signed in 2007 designed to increase 
economic growth and reduce poverty and a second com-
pact signed in 2018 involving investments in water infra-
structure, including supply and wastewater recycling, as 
well as water sector sustainability; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2018, the United States and 
Mongolia signed a joint statement and the Roadmap for 
Expanded Economic Partnership, outlining the intent to 
deepen the bilateral commercial relationship through full 
implementation of the obligations under the Agreement 
on Transparency in Matters Related to International 
Trade and Investment between the United States of 
America and Mongolia, signed at New York, September 
24, 2013 (in this preamble referred to as the ‘‘United

•HRES 1100 IH 
States-Mongolia Transparency Agreement’’), and to col-
laborate in supporting Mongolian small- and medium- 
sized enterprises through various programs and projects; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of the Census, trade be-
tween the United States and Mongolia is modest but 
growing, with a total value of trade in 2019 between the 
two countries of approximately $217,500,000, including 
$192,700,000 in United States exports to Mongolia and 
$24,800,000 in United States imports from Mongolia; 
Whereas Mongolia is a beneficiary country under the Gener-
alized System of Preferences program, but its use of the 
program remains low, as in 2018 only $3,300,000 of ex-
ports from Mongolia to the United States entered were 
under the program; and 
Whereas, on July 31, 2019, the United States and Mongolia 
declared the bilateral relationship a ‘‘Strategic Partner-
ship’’ and noted the shared desire— 
(1) to intensify cooperation as strong democracies 
based on the rule of law through safeguarding and pro-
moting democratic values and human rights, including 
the freedoms of religion or belief, expression, including 
internet and media freedom, assembly, and association, 
anticorruption and fiscal transparency, and youth and 
emerging leader development; 
(2) to cooperate in promoting national security and 
stability across the Indo-Pacific region so that all coun-
tries, secure in their sovereignty, are able to pursue eco-
nomic growth consistent with international law and prin-
ciples of fair competition; 
(3) to deepen national security and law-enforcement 
ties through collaboration on bilateral and multilateral se-
curity, judicial, and law-enforcement efforts in the region;

(4) to strengthen cooperation in multilateral engage-
ments such as peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance,

(5) to expand trade and investment relations on a

neurship, and continue to explore support for infrastruc-
ture under the new United States International Develop-
ment Finance Corporation with the new tools provided 
under the BUILD Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.); 
(6) to strengthen border security, prevent illegal 
transshipment and trafficking, expand cooperation on 
civil aviation safety and oversight, and efficiently facili-
tate legitimate travel between Mongolia and the United 
States; 
(7) to increase cooperation in addressing transna-
tional threats such as terrorism, human trafficking, drug 
trafficking, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc-
tion, cyberattacks, transnational organized crime, pan-
demics, and other emerging nontraditional security 
threats; 
(8) to continue to develop an environment in which 
civil society, social media, and a free and independent 
media can flourish; and 
(9) to maintain high-level official dialogues, encour-
age bilateral exchanges at all levels of government, and 
further develop people-to-people exchanges to deepen en-
gagement on issues of mutual interest and concern: Now, 
therefore, be it
