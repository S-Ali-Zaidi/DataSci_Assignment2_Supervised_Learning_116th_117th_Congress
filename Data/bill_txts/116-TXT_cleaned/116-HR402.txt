RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the significant milestone of Senior Corps 
volunteers serving 50,000,000 hours in 2018. 
Whereas volunteers in the United States who are 55 years of 
age and older (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘senior vol-
unteers’’) provide much needed services to their commu-
nities, neighbors, and friends; 
Whereas Senior Corps, through the RSVP, Foster Grand-
parent, and Senior Companion programs administered by 
the Corporation for National and Community Service, 
provides meaningful volunteer opportunities to 220,000

senior volunteers and recruits thousands of additional 
community volunteers; 
Whereas, for more than 5 decades, RSVP volunteers, Foster 
Grandparents, and Senior Companions have played an 
important role in strengthening communities by contrib-
uting their experience, knowledge, and accomplishments 
in order to— 
(1) help their neighbors recover from natural and 
manmade disasters; 
(2) provide nutrition services; 
(3) mentor and tutor schoolchildren; 
(4) support veterans and military families; and 
(5) provide respite care to caregivers; 
Whereas in 2018, Senior Corps volunteers provided more 
than 50,000,000 hours of direct service through more 
than 23,000 nonprofit, educational, and faith-based com-
munity groups nationwide; 
Whereas structured volunteering by senior volunteers— 
(1) keeps those senior volunteers active, healthy, and 
engaged; 
(2) helps communities across the United States by 
solving local problems; 
(3) helps the United States by saving taxpayer dol-
lars, reducing health care costs, and strengthening de-
mocracy; and 
(4) helps seniors live independent and productive 
lives; 
Whereas the RSVP, Foster Grandparent, and Senior Com-
panion programs have proven to be cost-effective ways to 
engage senior volunteers in volunteer service that meets 
pressing community needs;

Whereas recent research suggests that— 
(1) volunteering not only slows the cognitive decline 
of aging for older individuals in the United States, but 
also provides an important pathway for alleviating loneli-
ness; and 
(2) throughout the United States, and especially in 
rural areas, older individuals are ‘‘aging in place’’ and 
are thereby particularly susceptible to loneliness, which 
undermines health and is linked to early mortality; 
Whereas the United States should expand senior volunteer 
service opportunities to take advantage of the talents and 
experiences of the 10,000 baby boomers who will retire 
each day for the next 20 years; 
Whereas, at a time of mounting social need and growing in-
terest in service by older individuals in the United States, 
the United States has an unprecedented opportunity to 
harness the talents of senior volunteers to address com-
munity challenges; and 
Whereas the people of the United States should join in the 
celebration of Senior Corps volunteers during ‘‘Older 
Americans Month’’ in May 2019: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) acknowledges the contributions that Senior

Corps volunteers make to— 
3
(A) the communities in which those volun-
4
teers live and serve; and 
5
(B) the United States; and
