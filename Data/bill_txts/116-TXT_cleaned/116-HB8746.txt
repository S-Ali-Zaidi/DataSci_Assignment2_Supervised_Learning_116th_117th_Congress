(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) as a result of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
3
(COVID–19) pandemic, more than 40,000,000 peo-
4
ple in the United States have filed claims for unem-
5
ployment benefits since March 2020, which is a level 
6

(2) investments in fish, wildlife, and habitat 
9
restoration and outdoor recreation infrastructure 
10
generate as many as 33 jobs per $1,000,000 in-
11
vested, as demonstrated by the American Recovery 
12

13
123 Stat. 115); 
14
(3) the outdoor recreation economy— 
15
(A) generates $887,000,000,000 in eco-
16
nomic activity each year, which is 2.2 percent 
17
of the gross domestic product of the United 
18
States, according to the Bureau of Economic 
19
Analysis; and 
20
(B) was one of the fastest growing sectors

(6) enhancing and maintaining environmentally 
11
and recreationally important land and waters 
12
through the participation of unemployed individuals 
13
in the United States in a conservation corps could— 
14
(A) provide critical employment, education,
