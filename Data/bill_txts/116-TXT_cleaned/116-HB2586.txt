improve public services provided by the Federal Gov-
1
ernment based on customer feedback; 
2
(2) the people of the United States deserve a 
3
Federal Government that provides efficient, effec-
4
tive, and high-quality services across multiple chan-
5
nels; 
6
(3) many agencies, offices, programs, and Fed-
7
eral employees provide excellent service to individ-
8
uals, however many parts of the Federal Govern-
9
ment still fall short on delivering the customer serv-
10
ice experience that individuals have come to expect 
11
from the private sector; 
12
(4) according to the 2018 American Customer 
13
Satisfaction Index, the Federal Government ranks 
14
among the bottom of all industries in the United 
15
States in customer satisfaction; 
16
(5) providing quality services to individuals im-
17
proves the confidence of the people of the United 
18
States in their government and helps agencies 
19
achieve greater impact and fulfill their missions; and 
20
(6) improving service to individuals requires 
21
agencies to work across organizational boundaries, 
22
leverage technology, collect and share standardized 
23
data, and develop customer-centered mindsets and 
24
service strategies.

the people of the United States and seek to measure, 
5
collect, report, and utilize metrics relating to the ex-
6
perience of individuals interacting with agencies to 
7
continually improve services to the people of the 
8
United States; and 
9
(2) adequate Federal funding is needed to en-
10
sure agency staffing levels that can provide the pub-
11
lic with appropriate customer service levels.
