SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7141 IH
(1) Russia has repeatedly used its energy re-
1
sources as a tool to advance its policy goals and as 
2
a weapon to manipulate the decisions of other coun-
3
tries. 
4
(2) Such efforts include the nuclear energy sec-
5
tor, in which the Rosatom State Nuclear Energy 
6
Corporation (ROSATOM) uses subsidies and other 
7
state support to advance the political goals of Rus-
8
sia’s leadership. 
9
(3) Russia has long sought to expand its role 
10
and influence in the nuclear energy sector of the 
11
United States and of United States allies and part-
12
ners. 
13
(4) Since October 1992, the Department of 
14
Commerce has suspended an antidumping duty in-
15
vestigation involving uranium from Russia on the 
16
basis of an agreement by Russia to restrict the vol-
17
ume of exports of uranium to the United States in 
18
order to prevent the suppression or undercutting of 
19
price levels of United States uranium. 
20
(5) That agreement to suspend such anti-
21
dumping duty investigation is set to expire at the 
22
end of 2020.

(6) Section 3112A of the USEC Privatization 
24
Act (42 U.S.C. 2997h–10a), commonly known as the 
25

•HR 7141 IH
‘‘Domenici Amendment’’, provides limits on the im-
1
portation into the United States of low-enriched ura-
2
nium produced in Russia through 2020. 
3
(7) While Russia has mounted a disinformation 
4
campaign regarding the suitability of using nuclear 
5
fuel produced by United States companies in Rus-
6
sian-built nuclear reactors, ROSATOM is seeking to 
7
produce nuclear fuel for use in United States reac-
8
tors.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
10
It is the policy of the United States to— 
11
(1) ensure that the United States is not de-
12
pendent on Russian energy sources, including low- 
13
enriched uranium and the inputs for nuclear fuel; 
14
(2) assist United States allies and partner 
15
countries to reduce their dependency on Russian en-
16
ergy sources, including nuclear power and the inputs 
17
for nuclear fuel; and 
18
(3) use all necessary tools, including the De-
19
partment of Commerce’s entity list, to ensure that 
20
technology transferred to entities in Russia’s civil 
21
nuclear sector do not— 
22
(A) in any way contribute to Russia’s nu-
23
clear weapons program; or
