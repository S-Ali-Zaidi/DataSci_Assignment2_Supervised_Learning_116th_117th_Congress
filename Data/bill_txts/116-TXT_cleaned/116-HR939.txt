RESOLUTION 
Supporting the World Bank Group to lead a worldwide 
COVID–19 economic recovery effort. 
Whereas the worldwide COVID–19 pandemic is having a pro-
found and serious impact on the global economy; 
Whereas the world is highly interconnected, and working to-
gether can defeat the spread of COVID–19; 
Whereas the poorest and most vulnerable countries could be

felt, as health systems are strained, and many aspects of 
society are injured; 
Whereas it is in the international security and prosperity in-
terest of the United States to bolster economic and polit-

Whereas, since its creation in 1944, the World Bank Group 
has been dedicated to providing financial assistance to 
developing countries to promote economic development; 
Whereas the World Bank Group finances critical development 
projects that would otherwise go unfunded by private in-
vestors, is uniquely positioned to address cross-border de-
velopment challenges, and can effectively allocate aid 
globally based on need; 
Whereas high-income countries will be able to recover from 
the COVID–19 pandemic on their own, but low- and mid-
dle-income countries will struggle and need economic and 
technical assistance the World Bank Group can provide; 
and 
Whereas, in April, the World Bank Group announced efforts 
to respond to the COVID–19 pandemic in order to 
strengthen developing country responses and shorten the 
time to economically and socially recover: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
