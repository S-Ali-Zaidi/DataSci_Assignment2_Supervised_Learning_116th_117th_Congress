utable to the activities of growers, suppliers, researchers,

Whereas many of these wineries are small businesses and 
family owned; 
Whereas the wine industry directly employs nearly 1 million 
people in the United States and supports nearly 300,000 
jobs in industries that supply goods and services to 
winegrowers and wineries; 
Whereas the wages earned by those directly employed by 
wineries and the wine industry totaled more than $33 bil-
lion in 2017; 
Whereas wineries and wine regions not only drive economic 
activity through the production, distribution, and sale of 
wine but also attract substantial tourism-related interest 
and spending; 
Whereas wine regions in the United States each year host 
more than 43 million tourists and generate nearly $18 
billion in tourism expenditures; 
Whereas wine tourism supported 375,000 jobs that paid more 
than $10 billion in wages in 2017; 
Whereas American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) are designated 
wine-growing regions in the United States that have dis-
tinguishing features affecting viticulture, including cli-
mate, geology, soils, physical features, and elevation; 
Whereas the first American Viticultural Area was approved 
on June 20, 1980, for Augusta, Missouri, and, as of Oc-
tober 11, 2019, there have been 243 American 
Viticultural Areas established in the United States; 
Whereas at least 85 percent of a wine must be derived from 
grapes grown within the boundaries of the area in order 
to use the AVA name on its label;

Whereas an AVA designation allows vintners to describe more 
accurately the origin of their wines, and helps them build 
and enhance the reputation and value of the wines they 
produce; 
Whereas an AVA designation allows consumers to attribute 
a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic to a 
wine made from grapes grown in that area, and helps 
them identify wines they wish to purchase; 
Whereas appellations of origin, such as AVA designations, 
can assist American wine producers in establishing dis-
tinctive American place names in global markets and can 
create valuable export opportunities; 
Whereas wine exports generated more than $1.49 billion for 
United States producers last year, a threefold increase 
over the past 20 years; 
Whereas once an American Viticulture Area term, or other 
appellation of origin, is protected in a foreign country, it 
helps vintners effectively promote their products and in-
crease awareness of their region; 
Whereas the United States wine industry is growing and ac-
counts for 10 percent of global wine production; 
Whereas American wine-growing regions and wine growers 
have contributed not only to the economic prosperity of 
the Nation but have also enhanced its cultural prestige 
by developing and sharing with the world their inter-
nationally recognized wines; 
Whereas American consumers have benefitted from the rich 
diversity and extraordinary quality of American wines 
and wine-growing regions; and
