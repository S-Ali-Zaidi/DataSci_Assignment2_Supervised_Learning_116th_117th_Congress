SEC. 3. PERFORMANCE STANDARD FOR THE DETECTION 
15
OF PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS. 
16
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Director shall establish a per-
17
formance standard for the detection of perfluorinated 
18
compounds. 
19
(b) EMPHASIS.— 
20
(1) IN GENERAL.—In developing the perform-
21
ance standard under subsection (a), the Director 
22
shall emphasize the ability to detect as many 
23
perfluorinated compounds present in the environ-

ment as possible using analytical methods that are 
1
as sensitive as is feasible and practicable. 
2
(2) REQUIREMENT.—In developing the per-
3
formance standard under subsection (a), the Direc-
4
tor may— 
5
(A) develop quality assurance and quality 
6
control measures to ensure accurate sampling 
7
and testing; 
8
(B) develop a training program with re-
9
spect to the appropriate method of sample col-
10
lection and analysis of perfluorinated com-
11
pounds; and 
12
(C) coordinate as necessary with the Ad-
13
ministrator to develop methods to detect indi-
14
vidual and different perfluorinated compounds 
15
simultaneously. 
16
SEC. 4. NATIONWIDE SAMPLING. 
17
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Director shall carry out a na-
18
tionwide sampling to determine the concentration of 
19
perfluorinated compounds in estuaries, lakes, streams, 
20
springs, wells, wetlands, rivers, aquifers, and soil using the 
21
performance standard developed under section 3(a). 
22
(b) REQUIREMENTS.—In carrying out the sampling 
23
under subsection (a), the Director shall— 
24

1
drinking water near locations with known or sus-
2
pected releases of perfluorinated compounds; 
3
(2) when carrying out sampling of sources of 
4
drinking water under paragraph (1), carry out the 
5
sampling prior to any treatment of the water; 
6
(3) 
survey 
for 
ecological 
exposure 
to 
7
perfluorinated compounds, with a priority in deter-
