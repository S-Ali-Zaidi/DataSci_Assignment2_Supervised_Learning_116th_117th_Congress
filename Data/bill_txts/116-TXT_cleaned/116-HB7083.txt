SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
20
Congress makes the following findings: 
21
(1) The Joint Declaration and the Basic Law 
22
clarify certain obligations and promises that the 
23
Government of China has made with respect to the 
24
future of Hong Kong.

04:09 Jun 24, 2020

•HR 7083 IH
(2) The obligations of the Government of China 
1
under the Joint Declaration were codified in a le-
2
gally binding treaty, signed by the Government of 
3
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
4
Ireland and registered with the United Nations. 
5
(3) The obligations of the Government of China 
6
under the Basic Law originate from the Joint Dec-
7
laration, were passed into the domestic law of China 
8
by the National People’s Congress, and are widely 
9
considered by citizens of Hong Kong as part of the 
10
de facto legal constitution of Hong Kong. 
11
(4) Foremost among the obligations of the Gov-
12
ernment of China to Hong Kong is the promise that, 
13
pursuant to Paragraph 3b of the Joint Declaration, 
14
‘‘the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will 
15
enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign 
16
and defence affairs which are the responsibilities of 
17
the Central People’s Government’’. 
18
(5) The obligation specified in Paragraph 3b of 
19
the Joint Declaration is referenced, reinforced, and 
20
extrapolated on in several portions of the Basic Law, 
21
including Articles 2, 12, 13, 14, and 22. 
22
(6) Article 22 of the Basic Law establishes that 
23
‘‘No department of the Central People’s Government 
24
and no province, autonomous region, or municipality 
25

directly under the Central Government may interfere 
1
in the affairs which the Hong Kong Special Admin-
2
istrative Region administers on its own in accord-
3
ance with this Law.’’. 
4
(7) The Joint Declaration and the Basic Law 
5
make clear that additional obligations shall be un-
6
dertaken by China to ensure the ‘‘high degree of au-
7
tonomy’’ of Hong Kong. 
8
(8) Paragraph 3c of the Joint Declaration 
9
states, as reinforced by Articles 2, 16, 17, 18, 19, 
10
and 22 of the Basic Law, that Hong Kong ‘‘will be 
11
vested with executive, legislative and independent ju-
12
dicial power, including that of final adjudication’’. 
13
(9) On multiple occasions, the Government of 
14
China has undertaken actions that have contravened 
15
the letter or intent of the obligation described in 
16
paragraph (8) of this section, including the fol-
17
lowing: 
18
(A) In 1999, the Standing Committee of 
19
the National People’s Congress overruled a de-
20
cision by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal 
21
on the right of abode. 
22
(B) On multiple occasions, the Government 
23
of Hong Kong, at the advice of the Government 
24

8
didates in Hong Kong for Chief Executive 
9

(ii) expressed views on various policies 
11
for the Government of Hong Kong and 
12
other internal matters relating to Hong 
13

(iii) on April 17, 2020, asserted that 
15
both the Liaison Office of China in Hong 
16
Kong and the Hong Kong and Macau Af-
17
fairs Office of the State Council ‘‘have the 
18
right to exercise supervision . . . on affairs 
19
regarding Hong Kong and the mainland, 
20
in order to ensure correct implementation 
21
of the Basic Law’’.

(E) The State Council of China released a 
3
white paper on June 10, 2014, that stressed

that Hong Kong must be governed by ‘‘patri-
7

8
(F) The Government of China has directed

12

13
(G) The Government of Hong Kong, acting 
14
with the support of the Government of China, 
15
introduced an extradition bill that would have 
16
permitted the Government of China to request 
17
and enforce extradition requests for any indi-
18
vidual present in Hong Kong, regardless of the 
19
legality of the request or the degree to which it 
20
compromised the judicial independence of Hong 
21
Kong. 
22
(H) The spokesman for the Standing Com-
23
mittee of the National People’s Congress said, 
24
‘‘Whether Hong Kong’s laws are consistent

1

3
right to make judgments and decisions.’’. 
4
(10) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration 
5
states, as reinforced by Article 5 of the Basic Law, 
6
that the ‘‘current social and economic systems in 
7
Hong Kong will remain unchanged, as so will the 
8
life-style.’’.

(11) On multiple occasions, the Government of 
10
China has undertaken actions that have contravened 
11
the letter or intent of the obligation described in 
12
paragraph (10) of this section, including the fol-
13
lowing:

(A) In 2002, the Government of China 
15
pressured the Government of Hong Kong to in-
16
troduce ‘‘patriotic’’ curriculum in primary and 
17
secondary schools. 
18
(B) The governments of China and Hong 
19
Kong proposed the prohibition of discussion of 
20
Hong Kong independence and self-determina-
21
tion in primary and secondary schools, which 
22
infringes on freedom of speech.

5
lieved by citizens of Hong Kong to be part of 
6
an effort to ‘‘mainlandize’’ Hong Kong. 
7
(12) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration 
8
states, as reinforced by Articles 4, 26, 27, 28, 29, 
9
30, 31, 32 33, 34, and 39 of the Basic Law, that

China has undertaken actions that have contravened

the letter or intent of the obligation described in

20

11
fused to renew work visa for a foreign jour-
12
nalist, allegedly for hosting a speaker from the

15

16

17
prosecute police officers accused of using exces-
18
sive force during the protests in 2014.

•HR 7083 IH
China’s obligations under the Joint Declaration and

certain promulgated objectives under the Basic Law,

including that—

(A) as set forth in section 101(1) of the 
4
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 
5
(22 U.S.C. 5711(1)), ‘‘The United States 
6
should play an active role, before, on, and after 
7
July 1, 1997, in maintaining Hong Kong’s con-
8
fidence and prosperity, Hong Kong’s role as an 
9
international financial center, and the mutually 
10
beneficial ties between the people of the United 
11
States and the people of Hong Kong.’’; and 
12
(B) as set forth in section 2(5) of the 
13
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 
14
(22 U.S.C. 5701(5)), ‘‘Support for democratiza-

18
will remain equally true after June 30, 1997.’’;

20
under the Joint Declaration, the Government of 
21
China ‘‘resumed the exercise of sovereignty over 
22
Hong Kong with effect on 1 July 1997’’, the United
