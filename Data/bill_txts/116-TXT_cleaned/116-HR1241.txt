RESOLUTION 
Censuring Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. 
Whereas, on November 20, 2020, Representative Bill Pascrell 
sent a letter to the State Bar of Arizona, the Michigan 
Attorney Grievance Commission, the Office of the Bar 
Counsel of Nevada, the State of New York Grievance 
Committee, and the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme 
Court of Pennsylvania, to file a complaint against attor-
neys in each jurisdiction representing the campaign of 
President Donald J. Trump; 
Whereas Representative Bill Pascrell’s letters accuse the at-
torneys of filing ‘‘frivolous lawsuits’’ and requests each 
State agency ‘‘to commence an immediate investigation of 
their actions and consider sanctions for their conduct up 
to and including revocation of their licenses to practice 
law in your jurisdiction.’’;

HRES 1241 IH 
Whereas President Donald J. Trump’s campaign has a legal 
right to sue to ensure that each legal vote is counted and 
to challenge any illegal votes; and

State has the right to pursue every legal option to ensure 
ballot integrity and fair elections: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) the House of Representatives censures Rep-
2
resentative Bill Pascrell for conduct that threatens 
3
the livelihoods of American citizens in a way that is 
4
not befitting an elected Member of the House of 
5
Representatives; 
6
(2) Representative Bill Pascrell will forthwith 
7
present himself in the well of the House for the pro-
8
nouncement of censure; and 
9
(3) Representative Bill Pascrell will be censured
