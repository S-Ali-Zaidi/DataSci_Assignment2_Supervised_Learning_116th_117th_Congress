RESOLUTION 
Expressing the view that every individual is created equal 
and made in the image of God and the modern Demo-
cratic Party’s use of identity politics rejects all attempts 
to unite America and instead focuses on dividing individ-
uals into groups in order to achieve power. 
Whereas every individual is created equal and made in the 
image of God; 
Whereas the Republican Party believes that every individual 
American is endowed by our Creator with the unalienable 
rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; 
Whereas the Republican Party believes in judging people 
based on the content of their character and not the color 
of their skin, their ethnic group, or their gender;

Whereas a Democratic Senator attacked the then-Secretary 
of the Interior of the United States for not wanting to 
make hiring decisions based on race; 
Whereas House Democrats introduced a divisive COVID–19 
relief bill that would require companies who receive Fed-
eral aid to make decisions based on race and gender; 
Whereas a Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair can-
didate said it is her job to ‘‘shut other White people 
down’’ when they claim they are not prejudiced toward 
minorities; 
Whereas a DNC staffer announced that she prefers not to 
hire ‘‘cisgender straight white males’’; and 
Whereas based on the above examples and many others, rad-
ical members of the Democratic Party believe that indi-
viduals should be judged based on their group member-
ship and not on their individual merits: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the modern Democratic Party’s use of 
2
identity politics rejects all attempts to unite America and 
3
instead focuses on dividing individuals into groups in order 
4
to achieve power.
