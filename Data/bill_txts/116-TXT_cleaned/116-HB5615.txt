(1) the electric power sector is the second larg-
1
est source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United 
2
States today, producing approximately 28 percent of 
3
the country’s emissions; 
4
(2) heating and cooling homes accounts for over 
5
40 percent of residential electricity usage in the 
6
United States; 
7
(3) shade trees planted in strategic locations 
8
can reduce residential cooling costs by as much as 
9
30 percent; 
10
(4) strategically planted shade trees can provide 
11
significant carbon benefits both directly (sequestra-
12
tion by the growing tree) and indirectly (reductions 
13
in carbon emissions from electricity conservation); 
14
(5) low-income neighborhoods are disproportion-
15
ately impacted by the higher costs, poorer air qual-
16
ity, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses re-
17
sulting from higher temperatures; 
18
(6) trees can reduce the rate and magnitude of 
19
stormwater runoff and improve surface water qual-
20
ity; 
21
(7) trees reduce topsoil erosion, prevent harm-
22
ful land pollutants contained in soil from getting 
23
into our waterways, slow down water run-off, and

24
counted shade-providing or wind-reducing trees to 
25

residential consumers. If providing free and dis-

4
(2) The program shall either provide trees to 
5
plant to— 
6
(A) provide maximum amounts of shade 
7
during summer intervals when residences are 
8
exposed to the most sun intensity; or 
9

11
residences are exposed to the most wind inten-
12
sity.

14
science to create, as needed, and utilize tree-siting 
15
guidelines which dictate where the optimum tree spe-
16
cies are best planted in locations that ensure ade-
17
quate root development and that achieve maximum 
18
reductions in consumer energy demand while causing 
19
the least disruption to public infrastructure, consid-
20
ering overhead and underground facilities. Such 
21
guidelines shall— 
22
(A) include the species and minimum size 
23
of trees that are most likely to result in a suc-
24

sultation with the retail power provider with jurisdic-
18
tion over such transmission lines.

(5) The program shall provide tree recipients 
20
with tree planting and tree care instruction and edu-
21
