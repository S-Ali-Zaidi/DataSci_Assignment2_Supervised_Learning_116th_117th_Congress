Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF BUST OF ROGER BROOKE 
3
TANEY WITH BUST OF THURGOOD MAR-
4
SHALL. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) While sitting in the United States Capitol, 
7
the Supreme Court issued the infamous Dred Scott 
8
v. Sandford decision on March 6, 1857. Written by 
9
Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, whose bust sits 
10
inside the entrance to the Old Supreme Court 
11
Chamber in the United States Capitol, this opinion 
12
declared that African Americans were not citizens of 
13
the United States and could not sue in Federal 
14
courts. This decision further declared that Congress 
15
did not have the authority to prohibit slavery in the 
16
territories. 
17
(2) Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney’s author-
18
ship of Dred Scott v. Sandford, the effects of which 
19
would only be overturned years later by the ratifica-
20
tion of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the 
21
Constitution of the United States, renders a bust of 
22
his likeness unsuitable for the honor of display to 
23
the many visitors to the United States Capitol.

(3) As Frederick Douglass said of this decision 
1
in May 1857, ‘‘This infamous decision of the Slave-
2
holding wing of the Supreme Court maintains that 
3
slaves are within the contemplation of the Constitu-
4
tion of the United States, property; that slaves are 
5
property in the same sense that horses, sheep, and 
6
swine are property; that the old doctrine that slavery 
7
is a creature of local law is false; that the right of 
8
the slaveholder to his slave does not depend upon 
9
the local law, but is secured wherever the Constitu-
10
tion of the United States extends; that Congress has 
11
no right to prohibit slavery anywhere; that slavery 
12
may go in safety anywhere under the star-spangled 
13
banner; that colored persons of African descent have 
14
no rights that white men are bound to respect; that 
15
colored men of African descent are not and cannot 
16
be citizens of the United States.’’. 
17
(4) While the removal of Chief Justice Roger 
18
Brooke Taney’s bust from the United States Capitol 
19
does not relieve the Congress of the historical 
20
wrongs it committed to protect the institution of 
21
slavery, it expresses Congress’s recognition of one of 
22
the most notorious wrongs to have ever taken place 
23
in one of its rooms, that of Chief Justice Roger 
24
Brooke Taney’s Dred Scott v. Sandford decision.
