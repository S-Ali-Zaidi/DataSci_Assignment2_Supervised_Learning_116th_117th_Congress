Whereas these invisible wounds are frequently undertreated 
and poorly healed; 
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs has determined 
that an average of more than 20 veterans die by suicide 
per day; 
Whereas veterans account for a disproportionate percentage 
of all adult suicides in the United States; 
Whereas surviving family members of veterans who succumb 
to the invisible wounds of war are often forgotten and 
isolated; 
Whereas these family members lose their link to the support 
and strength of the military and veteran communities 
after their loss; 
Whereas the need for formal recognition of these families is 
vital to the strength, health, and survival of the commu-
nity of United States veterans; 
Whereas these families may be designated for recognition and 
support as ‘‘Purple Star Families’’; and 
Whereas the week of September 20 through September 26, 
2020, is an appropriate week to designate as ‘‘Purple 
Star Families Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of ‘‘Purple Star Families Week’’.
