the public trust and was inconsistent with the values and 
conduct expected of law enforcement officers; 
Whereas the law enforcement officers involved in the killing 
of George Floyd have been terminated from their posi-
tions and charged with crimes relating to their conduct 
and contribution to the death of George Floyd;

Whereas these peaceful protests are protected by the Con-
stitution of the United States through an individual’s 
First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, of peaceful 
assembly, and to petition the Government concerning 
grievances; 
Whereas what began as peaceful demonstrations have been 
exploited by violent extremists who have carried out acts 
of violence, looting, destruction of business and personal 
property, and additional loss of life, including the delib-
erate targeting of law enforcement officers; 
Whereas due to the actions of violent extremists, certain gov-
ernment functions have been temporarily closed, busi-
nesses have been forced to be shuttered, and livelihoods 
have been impacted; 
Whereas these acts of violence are considered criminal activ-
ity; 
Whereas the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) or Cap-
itol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) is a six-block self-de-
clared autonomous area within the Capitol Hill neighbor-
hood of Seattle, Washington, that was established by 
protestors on June 8, 2020; 
Whereas protestors commandeered the Seattle Police Depart-
ment’s East Precinct after a seven-day standoff with law 
enforcement officers and National Guard soldiers; 
Whereas rather than seeking justice for George Floyd, 
protestors have prohibited law enforcement officers from 
entering the CHAZ and/or CHOP zone and have de-
manded anarchistic and socialist reforms, such as the 
abolishment of the Seattle Police Department, the abol-
ishment of ICE in the city of Seattle, abolition of impris-
onment, free public house, free colleges, and rent control;

Whereas when law enforcement officers are prohibited by 
protestors from entering the CHAZ and/or CHOP zone, 
they are unable to carry out the oath they took to protect 
and serve the public; 
Whereas, on June 11, 2020, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan 
proclaimed, ‘‘Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone #CHAZ is 
not a lawless wasteland of anarchist insurrection—it is a 
peaceful expression of our community’s collective grief 
and their desire to build a better world’’; 
Whereas at a press conference the next day on June 12, 
2020, Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best directly contra-
dicted Mayor Durkan, saying that ‘‘Rapes, robberies and 
all sorts of violent acts have been occurring in the area 
and we’re not able to get to them.’’; 
Whereas members of the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club 
(PSJBGC), a self-described ‘‘anti-fascist, anti-racist, pro- 
worker community defense organization,’’ were reportedly 
carrying rifles in the CHAZ and/or CHOP zone; 
Whereas a shooting occurred on June 20, 2020, in the CHAZ 
and/or CHOP zone in which seven shots were fired in 
under three seconds and a 19-year-old man died and a 
33-year-old man was in critical condition; 
Whereas the Seattle Police Department attempted to respond 
and clear the way for emergency medical services, but 
they were met by a violent crowd that prevented them 
from accessing the victims; 
Whereas another shooting occurred on June 21, 2020, in the 
CHAZ and/or CHOP zone in which the victim was trans-
ported to Harborview Medical Center and was later re-
leased;

Whereas these acts of lawlessness take our Nation’s focus 
away from a safe and civil dialogue on issues of impor-
tance to our Nation; 
Whereas a free society depends on the rule of law, which is 
the foundation for the preservation of public order, peace, 
and individual rights; 
Whereas the United States has a troubled history of racism 
that includes slavery, the terror of lynch mobs, segrega-
tion, and Jim Crow, which leaves our country with impor-
tant work to accomplish; 
Whereas the just and unbiased enforcement of the rule of law 
and the protection of innocent individuals against 
lawbreakers is an essential function of government at the 
local, State, and Federal levels; 
Whereas the law enforcement profession is inherently dan-
gerous and police officers risk their lives every day; 
Whereas in 2019, according to statistics reported to the FBI, 
89 law enforcement officers were killed in line-of-duty in-
cidents; 
Whereas law enforcement officers are entrusted by the public 
to uphold the law; 
Whereas law enforcement officers who abuse their positions, 
engage in corruption, employ excessive force, or exhibit 
bias, betray the public trust and undermine the rule of 
law; 
Whereas good law enforcement cannot exist without account-
ability and justice; 
Whereas law enforcement officers swear an oath to uphold 
the public trust even though, through the performance of

the duties of a law enforcement officer, the officers may 
become targets for senseless acts of violence; 
Whereas law enforcement officers have bravely continued to 
meet the call of duty to ensure the security of their 
neighborhoods and communities at the risk of their own 
personal safety in the time of a viral pandemic; 
Whereas the resolve to service is clearly demonstrated by law 
enforcement officers across the country who have trag-
ically fallen ill or passed away due to complications of 
COVID–19 contracted in the line of duty; 
Whereas understaffed police departments and undertrained 
police officers increase the risk of encounters that result 
in the use of force, including unjustifiable or excessive 
force; 
Whereas a coalition within the New York City Council pro-
posed a $1 billion cut from the New York Police Depart-
ment budget in the 2021 fiscal year; 
Whereas, two Hartford, Connecticut, City Council Members 
proposed a 25-percent across-the-board reduction for the 
Hartford Police Department Budget;

voted to begin the process of defunding the Austin Police 
Department; 
Whereas, on June 12, 2020, the Minneapolis, Minnesota, City 
Council unanimously voted to abolish the Minneapolis Po-
lice Department, despite the fact that Minneapolis’s vio-
lent crime rate is one of the highest in the Nation; 
Whereas, on June 15, 2020, the Baltimore, Maryland, City 
Council approved an approximately $22 million budget 
cut for the Baltimore Police Department, despite the fact

that Baltimore saw 348 murders in 2019 with over two- 
thirds remaining unsolved; 
Whereas, on June 16, 2020, the Los Angeles, California, City 
Council voted to study ways to cut the Los Angeles Po-
lice Department’s budget by $100 million to $150 million 
dollars; and 
Whereas defunding the police would leave police departments 
understaffed and undertrained, while also increasing the 
risk of violent crime to the communities of the United 
States, especially vulnerable communities: Now, therefore, 
be it
