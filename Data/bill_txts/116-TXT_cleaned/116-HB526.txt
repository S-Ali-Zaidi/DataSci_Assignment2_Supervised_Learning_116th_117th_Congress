A BILL 
To promote free and fair elections, political freedoms, and 
human rights in Cambodia, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cambodia Democracy 
4
Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power 
8
in Cambodia since 1985 and is the longest-serving

leader in Southeast Asia. Despite decades of inter-
1
national attention and assistance to promote a plu-
2
ralistic, multi-party democratic system in Cambodia, 
3
the Government of Cambodia continues to be 
4
undemocratically dominated by the ruling Cambodia 
5
People’s Party (CPP), which controls every agency 
6
and security apparatus of the state. 
7
(2) In 2015, the CPP-controlled parliament 
8
passed the ‘‘Law on Associations and Non-Govern-
9
mental Organizations’’, which gave the government 
10
sweeping powers to revoke the registration of NGOs 
11
that the government believed to be operating with a 
12
political bias in a blatant attempt to restrict the le-
13
gitimate work of civil society. On August 23, 2017, 
14
Cambodia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the 
15
closure of the National Democratic Institute and the 
16
expulsion of its foreign staff. On September 15, 
17
2017, Prime Minister Hun Sen called for the with-
18
drawal of all volunteers from the United States 
19
Peace Corps, which has operated in Cambodia since 
20
2006 with 500 United States volunteers providing 
21
English language and healthcare training. 
22
(3) The Government of Cambodia has taken 
23
several measures to restrict its media environment, 
24
especially through politicized tax investigations 
25

against independent media outlets that resulted in 
1
the closure of The Cambodian Daily and Radio Free 
2
Asia in early September 2017. Additionally, the Gov-
3
ernment of Cambodia has ordered several radio sta-
4
tions to stop the broadcasting of Radio Free Asia 
5
and Voice of America programming. 
6
(4) On September 3, 2017, Kem Sokha, the 
7
President of the Cambodia National Rescue Party 
8
(CNRP), was arrested on politically motivated 
9
charges, including treason and conspiring to over-
10
throw the Government of Cambodia, and faces up to 
11
30 years in prison. The CNRP’s previous leader, 
12
Sam Rainsy, remains in exile. On November 16, 
13
2017, Cambodia’s Supreme Court dissolved the 
14
CNRP, eliminating the primary opposition party. 
15
(5) Each of the six elections that have taken 
16
place in Cambodia since 1991 were conducted in cir-
17
cumstances that were not free and fair, and were 
18
marked by fraud, intimidation, violence, and the gov-
19
ernment’s misuse of legal mechanisms to weaken op-
20
position candidates and parties. 
21
(6) In the most recent general election in July 
22
2018, following the dissolution of the CNRP, the 
23
CPP secured every parliamentary seat, an electoral 
24
victory that a statement from the White House

Press Secretary stated was ‘‘neither free nor fair 
1
and failed to represent the will of the Cambodian 
2
people’’. 
3
(7) The United States is committed to pro-
4
moting democracy, human rights, and the rule of 
5
law in Cambodia. The United States continues to 
6
urge the Government of Cambodia to immediately 
7
release Mr. Kem Sokha, reinstate the political status 
8
of the CNRP and restore its elected seats in the Na-
9
tional Assembly, and support electoral reform efforts 
10
in Cambodia with free and fair elections monitored 
11
by international observers.
