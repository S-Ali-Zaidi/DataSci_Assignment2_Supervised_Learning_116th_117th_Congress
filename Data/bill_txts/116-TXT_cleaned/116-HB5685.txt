(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
24
02:00 Feb 11, 2020
H5685
119 
•HR 5685 IH
(1) Widespread use of standards facilitates 
1
technology advancement by defining and establishing 
2
common foundations for product differentiation, 
3
technological innovation, and other value-added serv-
4
ices. 
5
(2) Standards also promote an expanded, more 
6
interoperable, and efficient marketplace. 
7
(3) Global cooperation and coordination on 
8
standards for emerging technologies will be critical 
9
for having a consistent set of rules to enable market 
10
competition, preclude barriers to trade, and allow in-
11
novation to flourish. 
12
(4) United States position on standardization in 
13
emerging technologies will be critical to United 
14
States economic competitiveness. 
15
(5) NIST is in a unique position to strengthen 
16
United States leadership in standards development, 
17
particularly for emerging technologies, to ensure 
18
continuing United States economic competitiveness

development is critical to United States economic 
5
competitiveness; and 
6
(3) the United States Government should en-
7

8
agencies and partner with private sector stake-
9
holders to continue to shape international dialogues

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
2
gress that— 
3
(1) since its establishment in 1950, the Na-
4
tional Science Foundation has been the gold stand-
5
ard for the world in funding basic science and engi-
6
neering research; 
7
(2) the National Science Foundation should 
8
continue to fund competitive, merit-reviewed basic 
9
research across all fields of science and engineering 
10
to achieve its statutory mission; 
11
(3) scientific research has become increasingly 
12
interdisciplinary, crossing the boundaries of indi-
13
vidual fields and the divisions and directorates of the 
14
National Science Foundation that support research 
15
grants; and 
16
(4) as the nature of scientific research changes, 
17
it is important for the institutions that support 
18
science like the National Science Foundation, to pe-
19
riodically evaluate whether the organization needs to 
20
evolve to continue to fund the best science, the best 
21
scientists, and the most groundbreaking research.

cation and training programs;

(2) evaluate and make recommendations for

of the Foundation’s business practices, including

H5685
164 
•HR 5685 IH
(1) Many reports over the past decade have 
1
found that it is critical to our Nation’s economic 
2
leadership and global competitiveness that the 
3
United States educates and trains more scientists 
4
and engineers. 
5
(2) According to the National Science Board’s 
6
Science and Engineering Indicators, the science and 
7
engineering workforce has grown faster over time 
8
than the workforce overall and now represents 5 per-
9
cent of all United States jobs, with a median salary 
10
more than double that of non-science and engineer-
11
ing occupations. 
12
(3) According to Bureau of Labor Statistics 
13
projections, the faster growth in STEM employment 
14
relative to overall employment is expected to con-
15
tinue, and the United States will need one million 
16
additional STEM professionals than it is on track to 
17
produce in the coming decade. 
18
(4) A recent report by ACT, the scholastic test-
19
ing service, found that only 20 percent of United 
20

graduating class were ready for first-year STEM

4
billion annually on STEM education related re-
5
search, programs and activities, but encouraging

STEM education activities beyond the scope of the

1
ited act was knowingly committed, in which case the

amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $250,000 for 
3
each violation. Each day an expedition remains in Antarc-
4
tica without complying with the requirements of this sub-
5
title shall constitute a separate offense for penalty pur-
6
poses. The amount of any civil penalty shall be assessed 
7
by the Director by written notice. Any civil penalty as-
8
sessed under this subsection may be remitted or mitigated 
9
by the Director.

(b) HEARINGS.—Hearings for the assessment of civil 
11
penalties under subsection (a) shall be conducted in ac-

such person to appear and give testimony before the Di-

8
the Attorney General to institute a civil action in a district 
9
court of the United States for any district in which such 
10
person is found, resides, or transacts business to collect 
11
the penalty and such court shall have jurisdiction to hear 
12
and decide any such action. The court shall hear such ac-
13
tion on the record made before the Director and shall sus-
14
tain the decision of the Director if it is supported by sub-
15
stantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. 
16
(d) PENALTIES UNDER OTHER LAWS.—The assess-
17
ment of a civil penalty under subsection (a) of this section
