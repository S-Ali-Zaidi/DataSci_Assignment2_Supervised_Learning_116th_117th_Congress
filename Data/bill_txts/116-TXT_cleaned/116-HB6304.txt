(3) in addition to the relief provided under this

creases in debt payments resulting from deferments

provided by lenders during the period of the national

emergency declared by the President under the Na-
8
tional Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)

5
of covered loans during the 1-year period following 
6
the date of enactment of this Act; and 
7
(3) when necessary to provide more time be-

11
visit requirements to—
