SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rosie the Riveter Con-
2
gressional Gold Medal Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Over 70 years ago there was a call to ac-
6
tion, a demand for workers to fill the vacancies left 
7
by the men who went to fight in the war. 
8
(2) More than 6 million women answered the 
9
call then, entering the workforce during World War 
10
II and providing the equipment, weaponry and am-
11
munition to achieve final victory and end the war. 
12
(3) These women left their homes to work or 
13
volunteer full-time in factories, farms, shipyards, air-
14
plane factories, banks, and other institutions in sup-
15
port of the military overseas. 
16
(4) They worked with the United Service Orga-
17
nizations and the American Red Cross, drove trucks, 
18
riveted airplane parts, collected critical materials, 
19
rolled bandages, and served on rationing boards. 
20
(5) Our ‘‘Rosie the Riveter’’, the women who 
21
worked and sacrificed to strengthen this country 
22
during World War II, are among the greatest living 
23
heroines in the United States. 
24
(6) These women persevered, despite often fac-
25
ing harassment from their male colleagues and dis-
26

approval from their male family members, and all 
1
the while continued to maintain their ‘‘other jobs’’ 
2
as caretakers of children and their households. 
3
(7) Minority women also overcame long-held 
4
policies of discrimination and made significant con-
5
tributions to the war effort. 
6
(8) Because of the ‘‘Rosies’’, Federal, State, 
7
and local agencies coordinated with business owners 
8
to develop childcare programs and other supports for 
9
working mothers. 
10
(9) The example that these women set during 
11
World War II continues to inspire us and blaze a 
12
path for the working women and young girls of 
13
today. 
14
(10) Specifically, the images of ‘‘Rosie the Riv-
15
eter’’ and the phrase ‘‘We Can Do It’’ continue to 
16
symbolize the empowerment of women today, rep-
17
resenting patriotic women who want to serve and 
18
strengthen their country, and to inspire young girls 
19
to become ‘‘21st Century Rosies’’ by aspiring to, and 
20
attaining positions of leadership in all walks of life 
21
in America.
