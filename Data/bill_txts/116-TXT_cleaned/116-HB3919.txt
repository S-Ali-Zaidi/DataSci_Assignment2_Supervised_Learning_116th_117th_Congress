SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds that— 
2
(1) coastal cities and communities are particu-
3
larly vulnerable to hazards and extreme weather 
4
events, accelerating the degradation of natural and 
5
built infrastructure that coastal economies and pop-
6
ulations depend upon; and 
7
(2) such degradation harms community resil-
8
iency and exposes coastal cities and their inhabitants 
9
to more frequent and more severe hazards, impact-
10
ing the ecosystems that provide livelihoods, food, and 
11
energy, and other essential benefits.
