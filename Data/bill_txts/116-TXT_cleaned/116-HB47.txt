H47
2 
•HR 47 IH
(1) criminal investigation of a person or matter 
1
is warranted; 
2
(2) that investigation or prosecution of that 
3
person or matter by a United States Attorney’s Of-
4
fice or litigating Division of the Department of Jus-
5
tice would present a conflict of interest for the De-
6
partment or other extraordinary circumstances; and 
7
(3) under the circumstances, it would be in the 
8
public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel 
9
to assume responsibility for the matter. 
10
(b) EXTRAORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCES.—For the 
11
purposes of subsection (a) extraordinary circumstances 
12
exist in any criminal investigation— 
13
(1) of the President, Vice President, their 
14
spouses or children, or any organization, enterprise, 
15
or entity owned by, under the control of, or serving 
16
the interests of the President or Vice President; or 
17
(2) which involves the activities of agents or en-
18
tities under the control of or allied with a foreign 
19
state acting in concert with agents, organizations or 
20
entities associated with the President or the Vice 
21

SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO THE ATTORNEY 
1
GENERAL. 
2
(a) IN GENERAL.—When matters are brought to the 
3
attention of the Attorney General that might warrant con-
4
sideration of appointment of a Special Counsel, the Attor-
5
ney General may— 
6
(1) appoint a Special Counsel; 
7
(2) direct that an initial investigation, con-
8
sisting of such factual inquiry or legal research as 
9
the Attorney General deems appropriate, be con-
10
ducted in order to better inform the decision; or 
11
(3) conclude that under the circumstances of 
12
the matter, the public interest would not be served 
13
by removing the investigation from the normal proc-
14
esses of the Department, and that the appropriate 
15
component of the Department should handle the 
16
matter. 
17
(b) MITIGATION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.—If 
18
the Attorney General reaches the conclusion described in 
19
subsection (a)(3), the Attorney General may direct that

21
terest, such as recusal of particular officials.

and impartial decisionmaking, and with appropriate expe-

•HR 47 IH
rience to ensure both that the investigation will be con-
1
ducted ably, expeditiously and thoroughly, and that inves-
2
tigative and prosecutorial decisions will be supported by 
3
an informed understanding of the criminal law and De-
4
partment of Justice policies. The Special Counsel shall be 
5
selected from outside the United States Government. Spe-
6
cial Counsels shall agree that their responsibilities as Spe-
7
cial Counsel shall take first precedence in their profes-
8
sional lives, and that it may be necessary to devote their 
9
full time to the investigation, depending on its complexity 
10
and the stage of the investigation. 
11
(b) METHOD OF APPOINTMENT; BACKGROUND IN-
12
VESTIGATION.—The Attorney General shall consult with 
13
the Assistant Attorney General for Administration to en-
14
sure an appropriate method of appointment, and to ensure 
15
that a Special Counsel undergoes an appropriate back-
16
ground investigation and a detailed review of ethics and 
17
conflicts of interest issues. A Special Counsel shall be ap-
18
pointed as a ‘‘confidential employee’’ as defined in section 
19
7511(b)(2)(C) of title 5, United States Code.

23

24
Counsel a specific factual statement of the matter to be 
25
00:21 Jan 09, 2019

investigated. The jurisdiction of a Special Counsel shall 
1
also include the authority to investigate and prosecute 
2
Federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent 
3
to interfere with, the Special Counsel’s investigation, such 
4
as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, 
5
and intimidation of witnesses; and to conduct appeals aris-
6
ing out of any matter being investigated or prosecuted. 
7
(b) ADDITIONAL JURISDICTION.—If in the course of 
8
an investigation the Special Counsel concludes that addi-
9
tional jurisdiction beyond that specified in the original ju-
10
risdiction is necessary in order to fully investigate and re-
11
solve the matters assigned, or to investigate new matters 
12
that come to light in the course of the investigation, the 
13
Special Counsel shall consult with the Attorney General, 
14
who will determine whether to include the additional mat-
15
ters within the Special Counsel’s jurisdiction or assign 
16
them elsewhere. 
17
(c) CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE JURISDICTION.—If 
18
in the course of an investigation the Special Counsel deter-
19
mines that administrative remedies, civil sanctions or 
20
other governmental action outside the criminal justice sys-
21
tem might be appropriate, the Special Counsel shall con-
22
sult with the Attorney General with respect to the appro-
23
priate component to take any necessary action. A Special 
24
Counsel shall not have civil or administrative authority un-

4
propriate Department employees to assist the Special 
5
Counsel. The Department shall gather and provide the 
6
Special Counsel with the names and re´sume´s of appro-
7
priate personnel available for detail. The Special Counsel 
8
may also request the detail of specific employees, and the 
9
office for which the designated employee works shall make 
10
reasonable efforts to accommodate the request. The Spe-
11
cial Counsel shall assign the duties and supervise the work 
12
of such employees while they are assigned to the Special 
13
Counsel. If necessary, the Special Counsel may request 
14
that additional personnel be hired or assigned from out-

16
shall cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the Spe-
17
cial Counsel.

23
tions of any United States Attorney. Except as provided

Special Counsel shall comply with the rules, regulations,

7
Justice. The Special Counsel shall consult with appro-
8
priate offices within the Department for guidance with re-
9
spect to established practices, policies and procedures of 
10
the Department, including ethics and security regulations 
11
and procedures. Should the Special Counsel conclude that 
12
the extraordinary circumstances of any particular decision 
13
would render compliance with required review and ap-
14
proval procedures by the designated Departmental compo-
15
nent inappropriate, the Special Counsel may consult di-
16
rectly with the Attorney General. 
17
(b) SUPERVISION BY OFFICIALS OF DEPARTMENT OF 
18
JUSTICE.—The Special Counsel shall not be subject to the 
19
day-to-day supervision of any official of the Department. 
20
However, the Attorney General may request that the Spe-
21
cial Counsel provide an explanation for any investigative 
22
or prosecutorial step, and may after review conclude that 
23
the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under estab-
24
lished Departmental practices that it should not be pur-
25

sued. In conducting that review, the Attorney General will 
1
give great weight to the views of the Special Counsel. If 
2
the Attorney General concludes that a proposed action by 
3
a Special Counsel should not be pursued, the Attorney 
4
General shall notify Congress as specified in section 
5
11(a)(3). 
6
(c) ETHICAL DUTIES.—The Special Counsel and 
7
staff shall be subject to disciplinary action for misconduct 
8
and breach of ethical duties under the same standards and 
9
to the same extent as are other employees of the Depart-
10
ment of Justice. Inquiries into such matters shall be han-
11
dled through the appropriate office of the Department 
12
upon the approval of the Attorney General. 
13
(d) DISCIPLINE AND REMOVAL.—The Special Coun-
14
sel may be disciplined or removed from office only by the 
15
personal action of the Attorney General. The Attorney 
16
General may remove a Special Counsel for misconduct, 
17
dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for 
18
other good cause, including violation of Departmental poli-
19
cies. The Attorney General shall inform the Special Coun-
20
sel in writing of the specific reason for the removal.
