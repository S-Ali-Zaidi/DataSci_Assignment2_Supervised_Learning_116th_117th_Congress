•HR 7544 IH
(1) Biomedical research sponsored by the Na-
1
tional Institutes of Health (refered to in this section 
2
as the ‘‘NIH’’) provides numerous treatments and 
3
discoveries that improve and save lives, defend the 
4
Nation 
against 
bioterrorism 
and 
emerging 
5
pandemics, strengthen the national economy, and 
6
support the next generation of researchers in the 
7
United States. 
8
(2) While the NIH is the largest source of 
9
funding for medical research in the world, the per-
10
centage of grants awarded has fallen over the last 
11
20 years. 
12
(3) The NIH Center for Scientific Review 
13
works with over 25,000 expert reviewers and applies 
14
the highest level of scientific and ethical standards 
15
to almost 50,000 competitive grant applications 
16
every year. 
17
(4) The NIH’s peer review process is a time- 
18
tested and proven method of identifying the most 
19
promising biomedical research proposals.
