(a) UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF DAMAGES FOR ACTUAL 
19
ECONOMIC LOSSES IN HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.—In any 
20
health care lawsuit, nothing in this Act shall limit a claim-
21
ant’s recovery of the full amount of the available economic 
22
damages, notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (b). 
23
(b) ADDITIONAL NONECONOMIC DAMAGES.—In any 
24

•HR 8527 IH
if available, shall not exceed $250,000, regardless of the 
1
number of parties against whom the action is brought or 
2
the number of separate claims or actions brought with re-
3
spect to the same injury. 
4
(c) NO DISCOUNT OF AWARD FOR NONECONOMIC 
5
DAMAGES.—For purposes of applying the limitation in 
6
subsection (b), future noneconomic damages shall not be 
7
discounted to present value. The jury shall not be in-
8
formed about the maximum award for noneconomic dam-
9
ages. An award for noneconomic damages in excess of 
10
$250,000 shall be reduced either before the entry of judg-
11
ment, or by amendment of the judgment after entry of 
12
judgment, and such reduction shall be made before ac-
13
counting for any other reduction in damages required by 
14
law. If separate awards are rendered for past and future 
15
noneconomic damages and the combined awards exceed 
16
$250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be re-
17
duced first. 
18
(d) FAIR SHARE RULE.—In any health care lawsuit, 
19
each party shall be liable for that party’s several share 
20
of any damages only and not for the share of any other 
21
person. Each party shall be liable only for the amount of 
22
damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to 
23
such party’s percentage of responsibility. Whenever a 
24
judgment of liability is rendered as to any party, a sepa-

rate judgment shall be rendered against each such party 
1
for the amount allocated to such party. For purposes of 
2
this section, the trier of fact shall determine the propor-
3
tion of responsibility of each party for the claimant’s 
4
harm.

(e) STATE FLEXIBILITY.—No provision of this sec-
6

7
effective before, on, or after the date of the enactment of 
8
this Act) that specifies a particular monetary amount of 
9
economic or noneconomic damages (or the total amount 
10

SEC. 384. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY. 
14
(a) COURT SUPERVISION OF SHARE OF DAMAGES 
15
ACTUALLY PAID TO CLAIMANTS.—In any health care law-
16
suit, the court shall supervise the arrangements for pay-
17
ment of damages to protect against conflicts of interest 
18
that may have the effect of reducing the amount of dam-
19
ages awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In par-
20
ticular, in any health care lawsuit in which the attorney 
21
for a party claims a financial stake in the outcome by vir-
22
tue of a contingent fee, the court shall have the power 
23
to restrict the payment of a claimant’s damage recovery 
24
to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the

claimant based upon the interests of justice and principles 
1
of equity. In no event shall the total of all contingent fees 
2

3

4
(1) Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered 
5
by the claimant(s). 
6
(2) Thirty-three and one-third percent of the 
7
next $50,000 recovered by the claimant(s).

(3) Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000

recovered by the claimant(s). 
10
(4) Fifteen percent of any amount by which the 
11
recovery by the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000. 
12
(b) APPLICABILITY.—The limitations in this section 
13
shall apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settle-
14
ment, mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alter-
15
native dispute resolution. In a health care lawsuit involv-
16
ing a minor or incompetent person, a court retains the 
17
authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than 
18
the maximum permitted under this section. The require-

ment for court supervision in the first two sentences of

subsection (a) applies only in civil actions.

8
party with sufficient insurance or other assets to fund a
