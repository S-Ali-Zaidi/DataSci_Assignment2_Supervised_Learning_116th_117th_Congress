SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of Congress that— 
4
(1) since joining the World Trade Organization 
5
in 2001, the People’s Republic of China has offered 
6
the United States a contradictory bargain, which 
7
promised openness in the global trade order, but 
8
through state mercantilism delivered a severely im-
9
balanced trading relationship;

•HR 704 IH
(2) it was erroneous for the United States Gov-
1
ernment to have ignored the contradictions and risks 
2
of free trade with the People’s Republic of China on 
3
the assumption that the People’s Republic of China 
4
would liberalize economically and politically; 
5
(3) benefitting enormously from a more open 
6
global economy to drive its own industries, the Gov-
7
ernment of the People’s Republic of China and the 
8
Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China 
9
have only tightened their grip on power, brutally 
10
suppressing dissent at home and pursuing policies 
11
abroad that are a far cry from being a responsible 
12
global stakeholder; 
13
(4) malevolent economic behavior by persons in 
14
the People’s Republic of China is made clear by the 
15
theft of intellectual property from the United States,

10
strengthen the position of the United States in its

policy toward the People’s Republic of China in

order to create a more balanced economic relation-
13
ship by safeguarding strategic assets from Chinese

influence, reducing Chinese involvement in the

16

12 
•HR 704 IH
(1) In its 2011 ‘‘Annual Report to Congress on 
1
Military and Security Developments Involving the 
2
People’s Republic of China’’, the Department of De-
3
fense stated, ‘‘China’s defense industry has benefited 
4
from integration with a rapidly expanding civilian 
5
economy and science and technology sector, particu-
6
larly elements that have access to foreign technology. 
7
Progress within individual defense sectors appears 
8
linked to the relative integration of each, through 
9
China’s civilian economy, into the global production 
10
and R&D chain . . . Information technology compa-
11
nies in particular, including Huawei, Datang, and 
12
Zhongxing, maintain close ties to the PLA.’’.

(2) In a 2011 report titled ‘‘The National Secu-
14
rity Implications of Investments and Products from 
15
the People’s Republic of China in the Telecommuni-
16

‘‘[n]ational security concerns have accompanied the

dramatic growth of China’s telecom sector. . . . Ad-
20
ditionally, large Chinese companies—particularly

Party, to include support for PRC state policies and 
1
goals.’’. 
2
(3) The Commission further stated in its report 
3
that ‘‘[f]rom this point of view, the clear economic 
4
benefits of foreign investment in the U.S. must be 
5
weighed against the potential security concerns re-
6
lated to infrastructure components coming under the 
7
control of foreign entities. This seems particularly 
8
applicable in the telecommunications industry, as 
9
Chinese companies continue systematically to ac-
10
quire significant holdings in prominent global and 
11
U.S. telecommunications and information technology 
12
companies.’’. 
13
(4) In its 2011 Annual Report to Congress, the 
14
United States China Economic and Security Review 
15
Commission stated that ‘‘[t]he extent of the state’s 
16
control of the Chinese economy is difficult to quan-
17
tify . . . There is also a category of companies that, 
18
though claiming to be private, are subject to state 
19
influence. Such companies are often in new markets 
20
with no established SOE leaders and enjoy favorable 
21
government policies that support their development 
22
while posing obstacles to foreign competition. Exam-
23
ples include Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and

such automotive companies as battery maker BYD

and vehicle manufacturers Geely and Chery.’’.

(5) In the bipartisan ‘‘Investigative Report on 
3
the United States National Security Issues Posed by 
4
Chinese Telecommunication Companies Huawei and 
5
ZTE’’ released in 2012 by the Permanent Select 
6
Committee on Intelligence of the House of Rep-
7
resentatives, it was recommended that ‘‘U.S. govern-
8
ment systems, particularly sensitive systems, should 
9
not include Huawei or ZTE equipment, including in 
10
component parts. Similarly, government contrac-
11
tors—particularly those working on contracts for 
12
sensitive U.S. programs—should exclude ZTE or 
13
Huawei equipment in their systems.’’. 
14
(6) General Michael Hayden, who served as Di-
15
rector of the Central Intelligence Agency and Direc-
16
tor of the National Security Agency, stated in July 
17
2013 that Huawei had ‘‘shared with the Chinese 
18
state intimate and extensive knowledge of foreign 
19
telecommunications systems it is involved with’’.

21
February 2015 Counterintelligence Strategy Part-

access to U.S. business communications is dramati-

4
exploited through Chinese cyber activity, with Chi-
5
na’s intelligence services operating as an advanced 
6
persistent threat to U.S. networks.’’. 
7
(8) The Federal Bureau of Investigation fur-
8
ther stated in its February 2015 counterintelligence 
9
note that ‘‘China makes no secret that its cyber war-
10
fare strategy is predicated on controlling global com-
11
munications network infrastructure’’. 
12
(9) At a hearing before the Committee on 
13
Armed Services of the House of Representatives on 
14
September 30, 2015, Deputy Secretary of Defense 
15
Robert Work, responding to a question about the 
16
use of Huawei telecommunications equipment, stat-
17

lutely not. And I know of no other—I don’t believe 
19
we operate in the Pentagon, any [Huawei] systems 
20

United States Cyber Command, Admiral Mike Rog-

Huawei telecommunications equipment is not used,

stated, ‘‘As we look at supply chain and we look at 
1
potential vulnerabilities within the system, that it is

a risk we felt was unacceptable.’’. 
3
(11) In March 2017, ZTE Corporation pled 
4
guilty to conspiring to violate the International 
5
Emergency Economic Powers Act by illegally ship-
6
ping United States-origin items to Iran, paying the

of

$892,360,064 for activity between January 2010
