SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The United States and France have shared 
3
close cultural, economic, social, and diplomatic rela-
4
tions since 1776 when French forces supported the 
5
American Colonies during the Revolutionary War to 
6
gain freedom from Great Britain. 
7
(2) World War II cemented this positive rela-
8
tionship between the United States and France. 
9
(3) On June 6, 1944, the United States, as a 
10
member of the Allied Forces, led the military oper-
11
ation known as Operation Overlord. 
12
(4) Operation Overlord consisted of a series of 
13
prolonged parachute and glider landings, large naval 
14
bombardments, massive air attacks, and amphibious 
15
landings on the beaches of Normandy known as 
16
Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. 
17
(5) Over 2,000,000 military service members of 
18
the Allied Forces landed in France during Operation 
19
Overlord, which resulted in approximately 226,000 
20
casualties. 
Of 
those 
casualties, 
approximately 
21
153,000 were injured, and 72,000 were either killed 
22
or declared missing in action. 
23
(6) Operation Overlord resulted in a victory for 
24
the Allied Forces as they forced Nazi Germany to 
25

withdraw from Normandy and move eastward to-
1
ward Paris. 
2
(7) June 6, 2020, is the 76th anniversary of 
3
the start of Operation Overlord. 
4
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
It is the sense of Congress that— 
6
(1) the United States owes to the generation of 
7
Americans known as the Greatest Generation an im-
8
mense level of respect and gratitude for risking their 
9
lives by serving in the Allied Forces to defeat Nazi 
10
Germany; 
11
(2) it is vital that the stories of the men and 
12
women who fought in Operation Overlord are not 
13
forgotten, allowing our youth to remember some of 
14
the greatest acts of heroism recorded in human his-
15
tory; and 
16
(3) the United States hopes to maintain strong 
17
ties with the Government of France and ensure the 
18
lessons learned from Operation Overlord are not for-
19
gotten.
