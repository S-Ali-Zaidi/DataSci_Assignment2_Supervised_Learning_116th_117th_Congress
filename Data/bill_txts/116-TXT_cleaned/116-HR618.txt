the present-day Slovak Republic proclaimed their inde-
pendence in the common state of the Republic of Czecho-
slovakia on October 28 and October 30, 1918; 
Whereas, on November 12, 1918, the United States and 
Czechoslovakia established formal diplomatic relations;

annexation of the Czech Sudetenland in October 1938, 
the subsequent establishment of a German protectorate 
over Bohemia and Moravia, or the creation of the Ger-
man puppet Slovak state in March 1939; 
Whereas the Slovak and Czech resistance movements against 
the Nazi occupation, with the support of the Czecho-
slovak government-in-exile, launched the Slovak National 
Uprising in August 1944 and the Prague uprising in May 
1945, accelerating the collapse of the Third Reich and 
demonstrating the courage, patriotism, and freedom-lov-
ing spirit of the Czech and Slovak peoples; 
Whereas the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized 
power from the democratically elected Government of 
Czechoslovakia in February 1948;

lowed the appointment of Alexander Dubcek as First Sec-
retary of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party;

tion-states after a peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia; 
Whereas the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on March 12, 
1999, and March 29, 2004, respectively, and have made 
significant contributions to NATO operations around the 
world; and 
Whereas the peoples of the United States, the Czech Repub-
lic, and the Slovak Republic have forged a special rela-
tionship based on mutual respect, close cooperation, and 
shared values of democracy, the rule of law, economic lib-
erty, and individual rights and responsibility: Now, there-
fore, be it
