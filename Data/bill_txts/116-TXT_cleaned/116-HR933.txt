RESOLUTION 
Recognizing COVID–19 frontline workers. 
Whereas COVID–19 is a generational event that has im-
pacted every aspect of our country; 
Whereas the fight against COVID–19 is America’s latest war, 
and our health care workers, food service workers, 
childcare workers, transportation workers, and more are 
on the front lines; 
Whereas we have called on our frontline workers to serve 
their country during this pandemic; 
Whereas frontline workers have answered this call and car-
ried out their critical missions to protect the health and 
safety of our communities and to minimize the disruption 
that COVID–19 has caused to our daily lives;

Whereas doctors, nurses, home care and domestic workers, 
and other medical professionals have put themselves in 
harm’s way to care for their patients, COVID–19 or oth-
erwise; 
Whereas firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, emergency dis-
patchers, Customs and Border Protection Officers, bor-
der patrol agents, security guards, corrections officers, 
and law enforcement officers have continued to meet 
their existing responsibilities to maintain safety and pub-
lic health while overcoming staggering new COVID–19 
challenges; 
Whereas farmers, farm workers, fast food workers, res-
taurant workers, food processing workers, and grocery 
store employees have ensured there is food available to 
put on the table to feed our families during the COVID– 
19 pandemic; 
Whereas communication workers have maintained networks 
that are stressed beyond their limits so that we are able 
to access the best information and stay as connected as 
possible through phone, cable, and internet, amidst phys-
ical isolation; 
Whereas truck drivers, commercial pilots, and food and sup-
ply distribution center workers have maintained critical 
supply chains, supporting the production and distribution 
of medical supplies, personal protective equipment, medi-
cation, food, and more; 
Whereas United States Postal Service employees and other 
carriers have maintained our Nation’s delivery and com-
munications network, connecting millions of homes, sup-
porting economic activity, and delivering critical goods, 
including prescription medications;

Whereas sanitation, custodial, janitorial, and cleaning service 
workers have played a critical role in minimizing the 
spread of COVID–19, particularly in high-risk places 
that must remain open, including hospitals, airports, and 
grocery stores; 
Whereas construction workers, electrical workers, steel-
workers, carpenters, millwrights, utility workers, machin-
ists, ironworkers, and other laborers have continued to 
work on infrastructure that must be constantly main-
tained; 
Whereas local, State, and Federal employees have upheld key 
government functions and services, which have become 
more important and more overwhelmed during COVID– 
19; 
Whereas childcare workers have continued to care for the 
children of essential personnel, allowing these personnel 
to meet their obligations and continue their critical work 
during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas Transportation Security Administration officers, pi-
lots, air traffic control officers, flight attendants, railroad 
workers, and transit workers have ensured that we are 
able to travel safely and return from across the country 
and around the world to be home with our loved ones 
during this public health crisis; and 
Whereas these workers, and other frontline workers, have 
continued to perform critical and essential missions dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
